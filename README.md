## Who is CiteWeave for?

- **Social science researchers** seeking advanced tools for literature review, citation network analysis, and argument mapping. (e.g. Political Science, Sociology, Economics, etc.). Since the system is designed to work with social science papers, the whole workflow might not be suitable for other fields. However, if you are in other fields and find it useful, please let us know!
- **Academic researchers** in any field who want to build a semantic, searchable database of papers and citations.
- **Anyone** needing argument-level (sentence-level) citation relationships between papers for deep research, knowledge graph construction, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

CiteWeave helps you truly understand your research papers by:
- Showing you not just which papers cite each other, but exactly **which arguments or sentences are being cited**‚Äîso you can trace the flow of ideas.
- Letting you **chat with your PDF library**: ask complex research questions and get clear, structured answers with aggregated information.
- Building a unique, argument-level citation network‚Äîperfect for deep literature reviews and discovering new connections.
- Making it easy for social science researchers (and beyond) to organize, search, and map out the debates in their field.
- All through a simple command-line interface (with a GUI coming soon).

## ‚≠ê Key Features & Architecture

- **Multi-Agent System**: CiteWeave uses a modular, multi-agent architecture for research question analysis, query planning, fuzzy matching, user clarification, data retrieval, reflection, and response generation.
- **Argument-Level Citation Graph**: CiteWeave is the **first open-source project** to build argument-level (sentence-level) citation relationships between papers. This means you can analyze not just which papers cite each other, but exactly **which arguments, claims, or sentences** are cited and how they connect across the literature.
- **Other Features**:
  - Enables advanced literature review, argument mapping, and citation network analysis at a much deeper level than traditional tools.
  - Ideal for social science and interdisciplinary research where understanding the flow of arguments and evidence is critical.
  - Supports semantic search, RAG, and knowledge graph applications for academic PDFs.

## ‚ö° Quick Start: Set Up All Services

1. **Set Up Your Python Environment**
   - Python 3.12 is recommended.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or use `poetry install` if you prefer Poetry).
   - **First-time only:** Download the NLTK punkt tokenizer (required for sentence splitting):
     ```bash
     python -m nltk.downloader punkt
     ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Copy the template: `cp .env_template .env`
   - Edit `.env` and fill in your OpenAI API key, Neo4j password, etc.

3. **Start All Core Services (Qdrant, GROBID, Neo4j)**
   - Download docker desktop if you don't have it already. (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - Download docker compose if you don't have it already. (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
   - Run:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

     To check if the services are running, run:
     ```bash
     python scripts/start_services.py
     ```

4. **Wait for Services to Be Ready**
   - Once you see the service URLs, you're ready to use CiteWeave!

> **Note:** These services must be running before using the CLI to upload PDFs or ask research questions.

## üñ•Ô∏è CLI Usage (All User Interaction)

**Workflow Summary:**
1. **Upload your PDF files** (required, provides the data for all research and chat)
   - Use `upload` for a single file, or `batch-upload` for all PDFs in a directory
2. **(Optional) Diagnose PDF quality** before upload
3. **Chat with the multi-agent system** to ask research questions about your uploaded documents

All user interaction is via the CLI. Do not use Python APIs or import functions directly.

### 1. Upload and Process PDF Documents (**First Step, Required**)

Before you can chat or ask any research questions, you must upload and process your PDF files. This populates the system with the data needed for analysis and chat.

**Single file upload:**
```bash
python -m src.core.cli upload path/to/your/file.pdf
```
- Add `--diagnose` to run a quality check before processing.
- Add `--force` to force reprocessing even if cached results exist.

**Example:**
```
python -m src.core.cli upload test_files/Porter\ -\ Competitive\ Strategy.pdf --diagnose
```

**Batch upload (process all PDFs in a directory):**
```bash
python -m src.core.cli batch-upload path/to/your/pdf_folder
```
- This will recursively find and process all `.pdf` files in the specified directory and its subdirectories.
- Progress and a summary of successes/failures will be printed.


### 2. Start an Interactive Research Chat (**After Uploading Files**)

Once you have uploaded and processed your PDFs, you can start a multi-turn chat session with the multi-agent research system:

```bash
python -m src.core.cli chat
```
- Type your research questions at the `You:` prompt.
- The AI will respond after each question, using the data from your uploaded files.
- Type `exit` or `quit` to end the chat session.

**Example:**
```
$ python -m src.core.cli chat
ü§ñ CiteWeave Multi-Agent Research System (Chat Mode)
============================================================
Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the chat.
============================================================
You: What papers cite Porter's 1980 book?
AI: [answer]
You: exit
Exiting chat.
```



## üìÑ PDF Processing & Quality Diagnosis

- **Processing**: The `upload` command will process the PDF, extract sentences, citations, and references, and store results in the data directory.
- **Diagnosis**: Use `--diagnose` or the `diagnose` command to check if a PDF is suitable for processing. The CLI will print quality level, processability, and recommendations.
- **Output**: After processing, you‚Äôll see stats (total sentences, citations, references) and example sentences with citations.

## üí¨ Citation Analysis & Research Chat

- **Start chat**: `python -m src.core.cli chat`
- **Ask questions**: e.g.,
  - "What papers cite Rivkin's work on strategy?"
  - "List all papers written by Michael Porter."
  - "What is the main idea of Porter's 1980 book?"
- **Supported queries**: Citation relationships, author papers, paper content, concept explanations, etc.
- **System response**: The AI will analyze your question, search the database, and return structured answers.

### Example Questions You Can Ask

You can ask a wide range of research questions, such as:

**Citation Queries:**
- "Which papers cite Porter's work on strategy?"
- "Who cited Porter's Competitive Strategy?"
- "Show me all papers that reference Rivkin's 2000 article."

**Author Queries:**
- "List all papers written by Michael Porter."
- "What are the main works of Rivkin?"
- "Which authors have collaborated with Porter?"

**Paper Content & Summaries:** (The paper should be uploaded first)
- "What is the main idea of Porter's 1980 book?"
- "Summarize the findings of Rivkin's 2000 article."
- "What are the key arguments in paper: Imitation of Complex Strategies?" 

**Concept & Topic Queries:**
- "Explain the concept of business model innovation."
- "What is the definition of competitive advantage?"
- "Which papers discuss imitation in strategy?"


Feel free to experiment‚Äîif your question is related to the content of your uploaded PDFs, citation relationships, or academic concepts, the system will try to answer it!
