## Recent Development Progress

### Enhanced Multi-Agent System - IN PROGRESS (2025-07)

**Status**: Core architecture implemented, multi-route workflow functional, language/translation and smart routing stable. Ongoing improvements in agent collaboration and error handling.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-language query support (automatic translation and response localization)
- Smart router agent with AI-powered multi-route decision (vector, graph, PDF, author index)
- Parallel execution of specialized agents (graph analysis, vector search, PDF content, author collection)
- Clarification and disambiguation agent for ambiguous queries
- Robust state management and memory for multi-turn conversations
- Extensible agent workflow (easy to add new data sources or logic)
- Integrated with LangChain and LangGraph for workflow orchestration

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Enhance multi-engine orchestration: enable flexible, dynamic routing and seamless integration of new data sources (PDF, Graph, Vector, Author, etc.)
- [ ] Strengthen error and exception handling: robustly manage missing data, model/service failures, partial route errors, and provide clear fallback and user feedback
- [ ] Expand QueryAgent and StubResolver for more advanced query types and citation resolution
- [ ] Improve ArgumentClassifier coverage and accuracy for more relation types
- [ ] Add comprehensive test cases for multi-agent and multi-engine scenarios

### CitationParser Module - COMPLETED âœ… (2025-07)

**Status**: Fully implemented and tested with comprehensive coverage

**Key Features:**
- Narrative and parenthetical citation detection
- Multi-word and Unicode author name support
- Complex multi-author and "et al." citation handling
- Academic prefix and false positive filtering
- Multiple citations per sentence
- GROBID integration for reference extraction

**Test Results:**
- Standard Citation Tests: **29/29 PASSED** (100%)
- Unicode Character Tests: **24/24 PASSED** (100%)
- Total Test Coverage: **53/53 PASSED** (100%)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/citation_parser.py` (core logic)
- `tests/test_intext_citation_extraction.py` (test suite)
