# Multi-Agent System for CiteWeave

This folder contains the core logic for the multi-agent system that powers advanced academic query and analysis in CiteWeave. The system is designed for modularity, extensibility, and robust collaboration between specialized agents.

---

## Overview

The multi-agent system orchestrates several specialized agents to handle complex academic queries, including:
- **Language processing and translation**
- **Fuzzy matching and entity confirmation**
- **Intelligent query routing with prioritized retrieval**
- **Information sufficiency assessment**
- **Graph database citation analysis**
- **Vector-based semantic search**
- **PDF/document content analysis**
- **Author-paper index and collection analysis**
- **Clarification and error handling**

### New Features

ðŸ†• **Fuzzy Matching with User Confirmation**: When searching for entities like "éº¦å…‹å°”æ³¢ç‰¹", the system performs fuzzy matching and asks users to confirm which specific person/paper they meant.

ðŸ†• **Prioritized Retrieval with Sufficiency Assessment**: Instead of parallel retrieval, the system prioritizes retrieval methods (e.g., embedding â†’ graph â†’ PDF â†’ author) and uses an AI agent to assess whether retrieved information is sufficient before continuing.

The main entry point is the `EnhancedMultiAgentSystem` class in `multi_agent_system.py`.

---

## Collaboration Workflow

The system uses a workflow engine to coordinate agent collaboration. The typical flow is as follows:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Query] --> B[Language Processor]
    B --> C[Fuzzy Matcher]
    C -- Needs Confirmation? --> D[Fuzzy Confirmation Handler]
    C -- Otherwise --> E[Smart Router]
    D --> F[User Confirmation Required]
    F --> E
    E -- Clarification Needed? --> G[Clarification Handler]
    E -- Disambiguation Needed? --> H[Disambiguator]
    E -- Otherwise --> I[Route Coordinator]
    G --> I
    H --> I
    I -- Priority 1 --> J1[Highest Priority Retrieval]
    J1 --> K[Sufficiency Judge]
    K -- Sufficient? --> L[Response Generator]
    K -- Need More? --> I2[Route Coordinator - Next Priority]
    I2 --> J2[Next Priority Retrieval]
    J2 --> K
    L --> M[User Response]
```

## Agent Responsibilities and Logic

| Agent | Responsibility | Key Logic |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **Language Processor** | Detect language and translate to English for internal processing | Multi-language support with translation tracking |
| **ðŸ†• Fuzzy Matcher** | Find fuzzy matches for entities and generate confirmation questions | Uses author index and vector search for similarity matching |
| **Smart Router** | Analyze query and determine retrieval priorities | AI-powered routing with priority ordering |
| **Paper Disambiguator** | Handle paper disambiguation and search | Search for papers based on entities |
| **Route Coordinator** | Manage prioritized retrieval execution | Sequential priority-based retrieval instead of parallel |
| **ðŸ†• Sufficiency Judge** | Assess if retrieved information is sufficient | AI-powered assessment with detailed explanation |
| **Graph Citation Analyzer** | Extract citation relationships from graph database | Citation analysis and concept mentions |
| **Vector Concept Searcher** | Semantic search using vector embeddings | Concept definitions and semantic similarity |
| **PDF Content Analyzer** | Analyze full document content | Document summary and content analysis |
| **Author Collection Handler** | Process author-specific queries | Author paper collections and metadata |
| **Response Generator** | Generate final responses | Multi-format response generation with translation |
| **Clarification Handler** | Generate clarification questions | Context-aware clarification with conversation memory |
| **ðŸ†• Fuzzy Confirmation Handler** | Handle fuzzy match confirmations | User confirmation workflow for ambiguous entities |

### Detailed Workflow Changes

#### 1. Fuzzy Matching Workflow
```
User Query: "éº¦å…‹å°”æ³¢ç‰¹" 
â†’ Fuzzy Matcher detects no exact match
â†’ Finds candidates: ["Michael Porter", "Michael E. Porter", "M. Porter"]
â†’ Generates confirmation question in user language
â†’ Waits for user selection
â†’ Updates entities with confirmed choice
â†’ Continues to Smart Router
```

#### 2. Prioritized Retrieval Workflow
```
Query: "What are Porter's key concepts?"
â†’ Smart Router determines priorities: [embedding_vector, author_index, pdf_content, graph_database]
â†’ Route Coordinator executes Priority 1 (embedding_vector)
â†’ Sufficiency Judge: "Information insufficient - missing comprehensive author overview"
â†’ Route Coordinator executes Priority 2 (author_index)
â†’ Sufficiency Judge: "Information sufficient for comprehensive answer"
â†’ Response Generator creates final response
```

Below is a summary of each agent in the system, including its responsibility, decision logic, and output:

| Agent Name                | Responsibility                                                                 | Decision Logic / Criteria                                                                                 | Output / Result                                      |

| **Route Coordinator**     | Manages execution of required agent routes, tracks completion                 | Checks which routes are pending/completed; dispatches next agent(s)                                       | Updated state, triggers agent execution              |
| **Graph Citation Analyzer** | Analyzes citation relationships and concepts using the graph database        | Uses selected/candidate papers and query type; determines citation direction                              | Citation relationships, concept mentions             |

| **Response Generator**    | Synthesizes results from all agents, generates final user response           | Combines outputs from all routes; uses LLM for structured, comprehensive response                         | Final response string, confidence score              |

**Notes:**
- Each agent is implemented as an async method in `multi_agent_system.py`.
- The workflow engine coordinates agent execution and state transitions.
- Agents may run in parallel or sequentially depending on the query and required data sources.

## Usage Example

You can use the multi-agent system as follows (see also the `__main__` block in `multi_agent_system.py`):

```python
from src.graph_builder import GraphDB
from src.vector_indexer import MultiLevelVectorIndexer
from src.author_paper_index import AuthorPaperIndex
from src.agents.multi_agent_system import EnhancedMultiAgentSystem

# Initialize dependencies (see __main__ for full example)
graph_db = GraphDB(uri, user, password)
vector_indexer = MultiLevelVectorIndexer(paper_root, index_path)
author_index = AuthorPaperIndex(storage_root, index_db_path)

agent_system = EnhancedMultiAgentSystem(
    graph_db=graph_db,
    vector_indexer=vector_indexer,
    author_index=author_index,
    config_path="config/model_config.json"
)

# Run a query
import asyncio
result = asyncio.run(agent_system.query(
    user_query="What is competitive strategy?",
    thread_id="example_thread",
    user_id="example_user"
))
print(result["response"])
```

---

## Exposed Interfaces

- **`EnhancedMultiAgentSystem.query(user_query, thread_id, user_id)`**: Main async interface for querying the system.
- **`EnhancedMultiAgentSystem.query_sync(user_query, thread_id, user_id)`**: Synchronous wrapper for quick testing.

---

## Extending the System

- To add a new agent, implement the agent logic as an async method in `multi_agent_system.py` and add it to the workflow in `_build_workflow()`.
- Update the smart router logic to route relevant queries to your new agent.
- Ensure your agent returns results in the expected format for response synthesis.
