However, complexity also undermines heuristics and learning. In the face of complexity, ﬁrms that follow simple hill-climbing heuristics are quickly snared on low “local peaks,” and ﬁrms that try to learn and mimic a high performer’s entire strategy suffer large penalties from small errors.

Introduction The profound inﬂuence of imitation on industrial dynamics is, by now, well established. The actions of imitators promote the rapid diffusion of new prod- ucts, processes, and organizational arrangements. The prospect of imitation may dull the incentive to inno- vate, but actual imitation may spur past innovators on to fresh invention (Schumpeter 1942). Rapid imitation, it has been argued, reduces the proﬁtability of an industry, the degree to which production is concen- trated in a few hands, and the ability of successful ﬁrms to maintain productivity advantages (Nelson and Winter 1982, Porter 1980). Accordingly, the strategists of successful ﬁrms seek to deter imitation. Empirical evidence suggests that at\n\nleast some ﬁrms meet this goal. Although information about new products and processes leaks out to rivals within about a year (Mansﬁeld 1985) and superior ﬁnancial performance at the ﬁrm level typically fades within ﬁve years (Ghemawat 1991), a handful of ﬁrms maintain superior proﬁtability—and presumably defy imitation—over long periods (Mueller 1986). Particu- larly striking is the ability of some ﬁrms to resist imitation despite extensive public scrutiny of their strategies. Firms such as Dell Computer, Southwest Airlines, and Toyota enjoy higher rates of return and faster growth than rivals even though journal articles, case studies, analyst reports, and books by founding executives reveal the ingredients of their successful recipes.\n\nManagement Science © 2000 INFORMS Vol. 46, No. 6, June 2000 pp. 824–844 0025-1909/00/4606/0824$05.00 1526-5501 electronic ISSN\n\nDownloaded from informs.org by [2a01:4b00:ad0a:5000:f0af:cb7e:c1e:4fc5] on 31 August 2023, at 23:25 .

Proponents of the resource-based view of the ﬁrm highlight factors that make imitation difﬁcult: impediments to factor accu- mulation, social complexity, causal ambiguity, tacit knowledge, economies of scale and scope, adjustment costs, and ﬁrst-mover advantages (e.g., Barney 1991, Dierickx and Cool 1989, Lippman and Rumelt 1982). Industrial economists, in contrast, emphasize moves by incumbents that make imitation unrewarding, even if it is fully feasible. In many game-theoretic models, for instance, incumbent ﬁrms undertake costly commit- ments that alter their own future incentives, make retal- iation threats credible, and thereby fend off copycats. This paper offers a sharply different explanation for inimitability. I propose, and argue formally, that the sheer complexity of a strategy can raise a barrier to imitation . In my formulation, two factors make a strategy complex: the number of decisions that com- prise the strategy and the degree of interaction among those decisions (Simon 1962). As the elements of a ﬁrm’s decision problem grow numerous and interde- pendent, imitation of a successful strategy becomes very difﬁcult. Indeed it can become “intractable” in a technical sense of the word. Hence, a ﬁrm can deter imitation by doing a large number of related things well even if none of its individual actions is inimitable. Because of interactions among the components of a strategy, a would-be imitator could understand most of the ingredients that make up a successful business system yet still fail to grasp the recipe. Although this paper provides the ﬁrst formal anal- ysis of complexity as a barrier to imitation, there are ample precedents—theoretical, empirical, and clini- cal—for the notion that complexity deters imitation. Theoretical precedents come, in part, from the litera- ture on knowledge management. (In this line of re- search, the object of imitation is typically a product or a process, not a business strategy, but the insights are still relevant.) Conceptual discussions of knowledge management argue that complex knowledge is hard to transfer. Authors differ, however, in how they deﬁne “complex knowledge.” To Winter (1987), complexity reﬂects “the amount of information required to char-\n\nacterize the item of knowledge . . . ” Zander and Kogut (1995) measure the complexity of an innovation by the number of distinct competencies it combines. Tyre (1991) gauges complexity by “the number, nov- elty, and technological sophistication of new features and improved concepts introduced” in an innovation, while MacMillan et al. (1985) consider a new product complex if it “requires extensive reorganization of interdependent procedures and/or the coordination of many skills and multiple departments.” The deﬁni- tion of complexity which I adopt from Simon (1962) encompasses the two major concepts from the knowl- edge management literature: the sheer number of elements in an item of knowledge and the degree of interaction among those elements. The proposal that complexity can deter imitation also draws theoretical support from the extensive, though diffuse, research on loosely and tightly cou- pled systems. This line of inquiry has focused not on imitation, but on the more general topic of change. Students of both biological systems (e.g., Glassman 1973) and organizations (e.g., Weick 1976) have noted that systems whose elements are tightly coupled to one another ﬁnd it difﬁcult to learn and adapt to environmental change. Extensive interaction across elements can immobilize systems in general, just as they do the imitators in the analyses presented in this paper. Among the research efforts on change in cou- pled systems, the recent work of Levinthal (1997) is particularly pertinent because it employs an analytical framework very similar to the one I use below. The concerns motivating this paper and Levinthal’s are distinct: Levinthal emphasizes the interplay between organizational adaptation and population-level selec- tion forces while I examine the process of imitation. While I show how tight coupling among elements of a strategy protects a successful ﬁrm from imitation, Levinthal identiﬁes a dark side of coupling: successful ﬁrms with tightly coupled systems ﬁnd adaptation difﬁcult in the face of environmental change. To- gether, the papers illustrate a tension between the protective power and immobilizing inﬂuence of tight coupling. I return to this in the concluding section. Beyond theoretical precedents, a handful of empir- ical studies support the notion that complexity raises a\n\nRIVKIN Imitation of Complex Strategies\n\nManagement Science /Vol. 46, No. 6, June 2000 825\n\nDownloaded from informs.org by [2a01:4b00:ad0a:5000:f0af:cb7e:c1e:4fc5] on 31 August 2023, at 23:25 .

(1997) document a bundle of interwoven human resource practices that resists imitation. In a study of pharmaceutical re- search, Cockburn and Henderson (1996) show that many ﬁrms are slow to match the organizational practices of rivals that make science-driven R&D ef- fective. They attribute the inertia, in part, to “complex complementarities” among the practices. Examining commercial banking products, MacMillan et al. (1985) ﬁnd that imitation proceeds slowly when a new prod- uct entails interdependent procedures that span de- partment borders. Case studies of individual ﬁrms also suggest that highly complex strategies can with- stand imitation attempts. In their discussion of “ﬁt” and complementarity, Milgrom and Roberts (1995) suggest informally that rich interactions among Lin- coln Electric’s many choices may explain why rivals have not replicated that ﬁrm’s well-documented suc- cess. Porter (1996) argues that tight ﬁt among numer- ous activities helps companies such as Southwest Airlines, Vanguard, and Ikea stave off copycats. More casually, discussions in popular business circles com- monly claim that some inability to “get the whole system right” stymies imitators. Though the proposition that complexity deters im- itation has numerous precedents, a formal analysis of the proposal is worthwhile. The analysis highlights, for instance, how interaction among the elements of a strategy—not the mere proliferation of unrelated ele- ments—makes imitation difﬁcult. It pinpoints the type of interaction that stymies copycats: interactions that apply in all business situations (e.g., a complex prod- uct line always necessitates a highly trained sales force) pose little challenge. Interactions that vary from one situation to another (e.g., a complex product line sometimes calls for a multidivisional structure) are far more problematic. The formal analysis identiﬁes gen- eral structural features that obstruct strategy making, and it allows us to talk with precision about the computational burden associated with a business strategy. It also allows us to see how great the time required to evaluate a strategy must be before com- plexity truly trips up copycats. The rigorous case for complexity as a barrier to\n\nimitation begins in § 2. There I construct a model in which (a) a ﬁrm must make decisions concerning multiple elements of its strategy, (b) the elements interact, and (c) all other barriers to imitation are absent. The model is an adaptation of a tool developed by Kauffman (1993) in the context of evolutionary biology and introduced into management science by Levinthal (1997). Critically, it parametrizes the two aspects of complexity: the number of elements in the strategy and the degree of interaction among them. This allows one to tune the degree of complexity and analyze how an increase in complexity affects the ease of imitation. I next show (§ 3) that interactions among decisions render the ﬁrm’s decision problem NP-complete, i.e., intractable to algorithmic solution. When interactions are pervasive, no general, step-by-step procedure ex- ists that can locate the globally optimal strategy quickly. Hence interactions among decisions play at least a crude role in determining the ease of imitation. When interactions are common and decision problems intractable, a ﬁrm that ﬁnds a good resolution of its problem can hope that it will be hard for others to discover its formula for success. If complexity renders global optimization intracta- ble, however, one must presume that thoughtful man- agers realize the nature of the challenge they face and opt not to attempt global optimization. Rather, they likely employ judgment and heuristics to ﬁnd good, albeit not necessarily optimal, sets of decisions (March and Simon 1958). Thus it is crucial that I show how complexity hampers not just global optimization, but also the heuristics that imitating ﬁrms plausibly em- ploy. Sections 4 and 5 demonstrate how complexity undermines reasonable forms of heuristic search. Sec- tion 6 discusses the robustness of the results, and a concluding section summarizes empirical and practi- cal implications.\n\n2.

      "section_text": "The Parameters. Two parameters, N and K , gov- ern the complexity of a modeled ﬁrm’s decision prob- lem. N is the ﬁrst aspect of complexity, the number of decisions that a ﬁrm faces. In the formal model, each of N decisions can be resolved in two ways. 1 Hence a particular strategy s , a conﬁguration of decisions, is a vector { s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s N }, with each decision s i set to either 0 or 1. Note that there are 2 N possible conﬁgu- rations of decisions. K controls the second aspect of complexity, the degree to which the decisions interact. The efﬁcacy of each decision is affected not only by the choice (0 or 1) made concerning that decision, but also by the choices regarding K other decisions. In the model, each decision i makes a contribution C i to overall ﬁrm value. C i depends not only on s i but also on how K other randomly assigned decisions are resolved: C i \u0001 C i ( s i ; s i 1 , . . . , s iK ). K ranges from 0 to N \u0002 1. When K \u0001 0, the contribution of each decision depends only on the choice made concerning that decision: C i \u0001 C i ( s i ). When K \u0001 N \u0002 1, the contri- bution of each decision is affected by all N \u0002 1 others: C i \u0001 C i ( s ). N reﬂects the reality that managers must make numerous decisions. A ﬁrm’s strategy is embodied in this nexus of choices. K captures the fact that the choice made concerning one decision may affect the marginal beneﬁt or cost associated with another deci- sion. 2 For instance, investments in machines that per-\n\nmit production of a complex product line are often made more valuable on the margin if a ﬁrm also employs a highly trained sales force that can explain the product line to customers. The marginal value of product inspection activities may be reduced by man- ufacturing activities that eliminate defects in the pro- duction process. A large number of recent studies document how choices often complement one another or substitute for each other. 3\n\nConceptually, N implies that managers are not searching along a single dimension for an optimal decision, as is sometimes posited in economic models. Rather, they are searching a very-high-dimensional “decision space” for an optimal combination of choices. This suggests the following image of a landscape: each of N decisions constitutes a “horizontal” axis in a high-dimensional space, and each decision offers dif- ferent options. Resulting from each combination of choices is a value for the ﬁrm, which is plotted on the vertical axis. The goal of the strategy formulation process is to occupy a high spot on this landscape, i.e., to select a combination of choices that, together, pro- duce a great deal of value for the owners of the ﬁrm. As I discuss below, the interactions introduced by K cause the landscape to become rugged and multi- peaked, and this makes the search for a high peak profoundly more difﬁcult. Note that a “strategy” in this formulation is pre- cisely a complete conﬁguration of N decisions. Re- searchers adopt widely varying deﬁnitions of the term “strategy.” Whatever deﬁnition one adopts, however, a strategy is realized in the marketplace as a set of choices that inﬂuence organizational performance. Ac- cordingly, this paper focuses directly on sets of choices. The choices encompassed by the N decisions include elements that many researchers would con- sider organizational structure, not strategy per se. For that reason, some readers may prefer to interpret this paper as addressing the imitation of entire organiza- tional conﬁgurations (Miller et al. 1984) or organiza- tional forms (Levinthal 1997) rather than strategies.\n\n1 This formulation assumes that the decisions concern discrete, not continuous, variables, i.e., that each can be resolved in a ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite number of ways. In reality, many strategic decisions present discrete options. The restriction to binary choice is made purely for convenience and does not affect any of the qualitative results of this paper.\n\n2 This is an adaptation of Milgrom and Roberts’ (1990) deﬁnition of “complementarity.” Under their deﬁnition, complementarity arises when performing more of activity A increases the marginal beneﬁt of doing more of activity B. I use the term “interaction” rather than “complementarity” to encompass both complementarity and sub- stitution between decisions.\n\n3 See, for instance, Cockburn and Henderson (1996), Hwang and Weil (1997), Ichniowski et al. (1997), MacDufﬁe (1995), Milgrom and Roberts (1990, 1995), Porter (1996), and Siggelkow (1998).\n\nRIVKIN Imitation of Complex Strategies\n\nManagement Science /Vol. 46, No. 6, June 2000 827\n\nDownloaded from informs.org by [2a01:4b00:ad0a:5000:f0af:cb7e:c1e:4fc5] on 31 August 2023, at 23:25 .

Although the precise landscape is a product of chance, the parameters that deﬁne the complexity of the land- scape, N and K , are controlled by the modeler. A payoff is assigned to each of the 2 N combinations of decisions as follows. Recall that the contribution C i of each decision to overall ﬁrm value is affected by K other randomly assigned decisions. For each possible realization of ( s i ; s i 1 , . . . , s iK ), a value contribution is drawn at random from a uniform U [0, 1] distribution. The overall value associated with a conﬁguration is the average over the N value contributions:\n\nN C i \u0003 s i ; s i 1 , . . . , s iK \u0004 \u0003 / N .\n\nNote that when K \u0001 0, P ( s ) is the average over N contributions, each of which depends only on a single choice. At the other extreme, when K \u0001 N \u0002 1, P ( s ) is the average over N contributions, each of which is affected by all N choices. Decision problems are generated by a process that is random in two ways: the K decisions that affect a focal decision are assigned by chance, as is the contribution C i corresponding to a particular conﬁguration of ( s i ; s i 1 , . . . , s iK ). At ﬁrst it may seem odd that decision problems are generated randomly. Recall, however, that the objective is to determine how complexity affects the imitation process typically , not for a partic- ular decision problem. The best way to accomplish this is to generate at random a number of decision problems of a particular degree of complexity, deter- mine average behavior on this set, adjust the complex- ity, and repeat the process. The role of chance in the modeling procedure re- ﬂects an important implicit assumption. The N deci- sions are choices whose relationships are not known a priori. If it is universally true and known that, say, two choices always “go together,” then those two choices are treated as a single decision in this paper’s model. A key purpose of strategy scholarship is to identify sets of choices that normally accompany one an- other—and thereby reduce the dimensionality of a\n\nﬁrm’s decision problem. I discuss this further in the ﬁnal section.\n\nImitation. Once generated, a landscape is em- ployed in one of two ways. In §3, I examine the computational burden associated with global optimi- zation on a typical landscape and show how that burden grows with strategic complexity. In §§4 and 5, I consider imitators that use simple heuristics to try to match a benchmark ﬁrm. The effectiveness of each heuristic is assessed by a series of Monte Carlo simu- lations. I begin the simulations by ﬁxing N and K . For a given level of N and K , a number of landscapes are generated. On each landscape, a high point, s \u0001 , is identiﬁed as the best outcome of 100 exploratory searches, and a benchmark ﬁrm is assigned this strat- egy. Five hundred would-be imitators are then re- leased at random initial locations on the landscape. That is, each is assigned an initial decision conﬁgura- tion, or strategy, by chance. Each imitator uses a heuristic to search for higher ground—better sets of decisions—and I record how successful the typical imitator is for that level of complexity. I then adjust N and K and repeat the process. This isolates how the complexity of the underlying decision problem makes the imitation heuristic more or less effective. Three forms of search heuristic are considered. Under the incremental improvement heuristic, an imitat- ing ﬁrm considers all alternative strategies that in- volve changing M or fewer of its current decisions. It accepts an alternative if and only if the alternative generates a higher payoff. Once it has adopted the new strategy, the imitator considers another incre- mental change, and so forth until the ﬁrm reaches a (possibly local) peak. The parameter M governs how local the search is. M \u0001 1 implies a polar version of local search, employed by researchers such as Levinthal (1997). M \u0001 N constitutes global search. Under follow-the-leader imitation , a ﬁrm at s attempts a major reconﬁguration toward s \u0001 . J of its N decisions are adjusted to match the benchmark ﬁrm’s choices. The probability that each decision is matched correctly is \u0002 \u0003 1. \u0002 is ordinarily less than 1, reﬂecting the fact that an imitator may not understand the benchmark ﬁrm’s operations perfectly, does not have full access to the template (Nelson and Winter 1982) provided by\n\nRIVKIN Imitation of Complex Strategies\n\n828 Management Science /Vol. 46, No. 6, June 2000\n\nDownloaded from informs.org by [2a01:4b00:ad0a:5000:f0af:cb7e:c1e:4fc5] on 31 August 2023, at 23:25 .

In contrast to a follow-the-leader imitator, an incre- mental improver is “imitating” the benchmark ﬁrm only in a weak sense of the word. An incremental improver does not use any information about the strategy of the benchmark ﬁrm actively. Rather, it operates under the hope that incremental improve- ment will lead it to rediscover the benchmark’s suc- cess. Hence the cognitive models underlying the two heuristics are very different. I also consider a third search heuristic, a hybrid in which a ﬁrm jumps toward the benchmark in follow- the-leader fashion, tweaks uphill to a local peak, jumps again if necessary, and so forth. This hybrid captures three aspects of reality. It recognizes that ﬁrms are capable of both major reorientations and incremental change (Miller et al. 1984). It models imitation as an on-going effort, not a one-shot attempt to mimic success. And it permits rivals to start their imitation attempts (after the initial leap) clustered around the benchmark rather than spread uniformly over the landscape. As noted above, the benchmark in each simulation is pinpointed by a series of exploratory searches. One hundred ﬁrms, released at random locations on the landscape, search for better strategies, and the top performer serves as a standard. In all cases, the search heuristic employed in the exploratory phase is the same as that used by the subsequent imitators. The results are robust with respect to the method used to determine the benchmark (§6). The primary simulation results of the paper exam- ine how well imitators match a benchmark ﬁrm. Additional results show how the benchmark itself evolves over time. Speciﬁcally, I release thousands of ﬁrms sequentially on unexplored landscapes, allow each ﬁrm to seek a successful strategy using one of the heuristics described above, and record when “leader- ship” in the market changes hands. The ﬁrst ﬁrm released on the landscape sets an initial benchmark for performance. The second ﬁrm may match that bench- mark, achieve a worse performance, or exceed the benchmark—in which case it sets a new benchmark. By repeating this analysis for various levels of N and\n\nK , I isolate the effect of complexity on the evolution of the benchmark. These additional simulations and the primary simulations envision quite different industry settings. The primary simulations reﬂect a mature business in which an imitator attempts to mimic a well-established leader. The additional simulations apply better to an emerging industry in which the standards for performance are still in ﬂux. It is important to note what the model excludes . Imitators face no costs of adjustment, no threats of retaliation from the incumbent high performer, no fear that colocation with the high performer will lead to intense competition, no second-mover disadvantages, no barriers to modifying individual decisions, no economies of scale or scope, and no impediments to resource accumulation. Search costs are set to zero; indeed, the incremental improver knows the value of all neighboring strategies within a radius of M per- fectly without cost or commitment. The real and important fact that some decisions are harder to change than others is purposely suppressed. In short, none of the conventional deterrents to imitation are present. Any barriers that imitators face derive purely from the complexity of the underlying decision prob- lem, coupled with modest limits on what the ﬁrm knows and can do.\n\n2.2. Antecedents in Evolutionary Biology Some readers will recognize the modeling approach as a modiﬁcation of the NK model developed by evolu- tionary biologist Stuart Kauffman and his colleagues (Kauffman 1993 and references therein). Kauffman devised the NK model in order to examine how biological entities such as proteins and organisms evolve. Just as managerial decision making can be conceived of as a hill-climbing search in a high- dimensional decision space for an internally consistent set of choices, so evolution has often been seen as a hunt in a high-dimensional genetic space for a peak combination of genes (Wright 1931). Of course, the biological analogy is not perfect. Managers can scan the strategies adopted by their rivals, learn from them, and purposely reconﬁgure their choices to match the competition. Mice, on the other hand, cannot modify their genetic makeup to be more elephantine, no matter how much they admire\n\nRIVKIN Imitation of Complex Strategies\n\nManagement Science /Vol. 46, No. 6, June 2000 829\n\nDownloaded from informs.org by [2a01:4b00:ad0a:5000:f0af:cb7e:c1e:4fc5] on 31 August 2023, at 23:25 .

When transporting intellectual goods across disci- pline borders, as I am doing here, one must declare clearly what is old, what is borrowed, and what is new. The particular process for generating landscapes and the use of simulation are taken, unmodiﬁed, from Kauffman (1993). As subsequent references make clear, the structural features of landscapes I discuss below are identiﬁed by Kauffman and other users of the NK model. Prior efforts, however, do not explore the collective effect of those features on imitation attempts. Of the search heuristics I explore, the incre- mental improvement mode is identical to the search process employed by most of Kauffman’s biological entities. The informed follow-the-leader heuristic and the hybrid heuristic are new. Indeed, such purposeful search processes make little sense in the context of biological evolution. Similarly, the use of a benchmark toward which followers aim is an innovation. Kauff- man (1993) speculates on the computational burden imposed by the NK model but, since the agents in his models cannot devise algorithms, he need not prove the intractability of optimization as I do below. Al- though developed in the context of evolutionary biol- ogy, NK models are beginning to ﬁnd applications in management science (McKelvey 1999 and references therein). None of these efforts examine imitation.\n\n2.3. Interactions and Landscape Ruggedness A crucial feature of the modeling approach is that, by means of K , it parametrizes the richness of interaction among the elements of the ﬁrm’s strategy. Much of the intuition concerning the effects of K depends on the following insight: as the pieces of a strategy become more interdependent, the landscape corresponding to a ﬁrm’s decision problem becomes increasingly rug- ged. That is, the correlation between the altitudes of adjacent points on the landscape—points that differ by how one decision is made—falls, and local peaks proliferate. In the biological context, Kauffman (1993, pp. 54–63) goes to great lengths to show that this is the case. Here I give two examples that provide some intuition concerning the link between K and landscape ruggedness.\n\nFirst, consider the extreme cases of K \u0001 0 and K \u0001 N \u0002 1. When K \u0001 0, choices make independent contributions to ﬁrm value. In this situation, alteration of a single decision changes the contribution of that decision alone. Adjacent locations on the terrain— conﬁgurations that differ by how a single decision is resolved—cannot differ in elevation by more than 1/ N , so the landscape is relatively smooth. Moreover, from any initial location on the landscape, ﬁrms can rise to the global peak via a series of value-improving, single-decision “tweaks.” Management simply adjusts each choice, one by one, to the option that allows that decision to make the greater contribution in isolation. Hence when K \u0001 0, one has a smooth landscape with a single peak whose basin of attraction is the entire decision space. In contrast, K \u0001 N \u0002 1 implies that every decision inﬂuences the contribution of every other choice. Then, a small step on the landscape—a change in a single decision—alters the value contributions of all N elements. Adjacent decision conﬁgurations have levels of value (elevations) that are altogether uncorrelated with one another, and the impact of a single decision is bounded above by 1 and below by \u0002 1. The land- scape is fully random with many local peaks. The landscapes considered here exist in such high- dimensional spaces that they cannot be depicted di- rectly, but random walks on typical landscapes can convey a sense of ruggedness. Figure 1 does this for N \u0001 24 and various values of K . As K rises, the landscape grows rugged, and the elevation at any step becomes a poor predictor of the elevation at the next step. The intuition of why interactions may deter imita- tion now begins to become clear. In a richly interactive system, global optimization is difﬁcult. In graphic terms, it is hard to pinpoint and scale the highest peak on rugged terrain. Incremental improvement is inef- fective. In enhancing the performance of one element of the system, managers may inadvertently under- mine other parts. The ﬁrm quickly becomes ensnared in a web of conﬂicting constraints. Graphically, the ﬁrm is trapped on a low local peak. A wholesale reconﬁguration might free the ﬁrm from the local peak and take it to a much higher location. Unfortunately, interactions also make such large-scale changes risky.\n\nRIVKIN Imitation of Complex Strategies\n\n830 Management Science /Vol. 46, No. 6, June 2000\n\nDownloaded from informs.org by [2a01:4b00:ad0a:5000:f0af:cb7e:c1e:4fc5] on 31 August 2023, at 23:25 . For personal use only, all rights reserved.\n\nIn a long jump on rugged terrain, a miscalculation on any one of many dimensions can cause a ﬁrm to land in a trough instead of atop the intended peak. The landscape metaphor alone gives us this intu- ition. The mathematical model of the landscape allows us to deepen our understanding of how complexity deters imitation.\n\n3. Intractability of the Strategy Formulation Problem Complexity cannot deter imitation unless it ﬁrst makes global optimization difﬁcult. Suppose that the decision problems posed by the model are easily solved by some algorithm, regardless of N or K . Then a benchmark ﬁrm that ﬁnds even the best possible set of decisions will see its strategy quickly discovered by others and replicated (unless some other barrier to\n\nimitation intercedes). Complexity alone would pose no obstacle to imitation. This section proves that complexity indeed makes global optimization hard. When decisions are numer- ous and cross-coupled, the strategy formulation prob- lem deﬁes algorithmic solution. It becomes intractable, in the technical sense of algorithm theory.\n\n3.1.

The tractability of a particular problem hinges on its time complexity func- tion , which relates the size of a speciﬁc instance of a problem ( n ) to the time that a given algorithm re- quires to solve the problem ( t ( n )). An algorithm is any general, step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. A critical distinction exists between polynomial time algorithms, for which t is some polynomial function of n , and exponential time algorithms, for which t is an exponential function of n . This distinction is crucial because exponential functions grow far faster than polynomial functions. Algorithms with exponential time complexity become impractical for large in- stances while algorithms with polynomial time com- plexity remain feasible. Problems for which polyno- mial time algorithms exist are said to fall into the P class and are considered by algorithm designers to be well solved. Problems for which no polynomial time algorithms exist are labeled “intractable.” Deﬁnitively proving intractability, however, turns out to be difﬁcult, and this difﬁculty has led to two additional concepts: the NP class of problems and NP -completeness. Many problems for which no poly- nomial time algorithm has been found could, in the- ory, be solved in polynomial time if one had a “non- deterministic computer,” a machine with unlimited parallel processing capabilities. Such problems fall into the nondeterministic polynomial , or NP , class . P \u0002 NP . Moreover, it is widely believed (but not yet proven) that P \u0003 NP , i.e., there are NP problems with no polynomial time solutions. The NP - complete class of problems is a subset of NP problems which have been shown to be as hard as any in the NP class. Transfor- mations have been devised that permit one to convert each NP -complete problem into others in polynomial time. Therefore, if one could ﬁnd a polynomial time algorithm for any NP -complete problem, one could devise such an algorithm for all NP problems. Con- versely, if any problem in the NP class is intractable, all NP -complete problems are intractable. Hundreds of problems have now been shown to fall into the NP -complete class (Garey and Johnson 1979). It is widely believed, though not yet proven, that the NP -complete problems are all intractable. In all like- lihood, no general , step-by-step procedure can be devised to\n\nsolve an NP-complete problem of large size in reasonable time .\n\n3.2. Strategic Complexity and NP-Completeness Now consider the implications for the strategy formu- lation problem as formalized in this paper. Suppose a group of managers faces a decision problem, an NK landscape, whose topography is unknown. Given some time, the managers can correctly evaluate the payoff of any proposed strategy. Can they write down an algorithm that will quickly locate the best set of choices? It turns out that the answer hinges on K . As the degree of interaction among a ﬁrm’s decisions rises, the NK problem goes from being a member of the P class of problems to being NP -complete. The time required for any algorithm to ﬁnd the best strategy switches from being a polynomial function of N to being an exponential function of N (under the standard assumption that P \u0005 NP ). To see this, ﬁrst consider the NK model with no interactions, K \u0001 0. Trivially, this can be solved in polynomial time by an algorithm that optimizes each of the N decisions one-by-one, by choosing the better of the two alternatives. The time complexity function associated with this problem is simply a linear func- tion of N . An appendix available from the author proves, however, that the NK model with K \u0006 2 produces an NP -complete problem. The proof proceeds roughly as follows: The NK problem with K \u0006 2 is ﬁrst shown to belong to the NP class. A particular problem that is widely known to be NP -complete, the so-called “ K - satisﬁability problem,” is then chosen. Since the K -satisﬁability problem is NP -complete, it is as hard as any in the NP class. It is next shown that any K -satisﬁability problem can be transformed in polyno- mial time into an NK model with K \u0006 2. Such an NK problem is therefore at least as hard as the K -satisﬁ- ability problem; if the NK problem could be solved in polynomial time, then one could also solve the K - satisﬁability problem in polynomial time by trans- forming it into an NK problem and solving the trans- formed problem. In sum, the NK problem with K \u0006 2 is in the NP class and is at least as hard as the K -satisﬁability problem, which itself is at least as hard as any problem in NP . One concludes that the NK\n\nRIVKIN Imitation of Complex Strategies\n\n832 Management Science /Vol. 46, No. 6, June 2000\n\nDownloaded from informs.org by [2a01:4b00:ad0a:5000:f0af:cb7e:c1e:4fc5] on 31 August 2023, at 23:25 .

Under the standard assumption that P \u0005 NP , the NK problem is intractable for K \u0006 2.\n\n3.3. Implications The ﬁrst consequence of NP -completeness, the one most germane to this paper, is that K delineates two categories of decision problems. In the low- K cate- gory, decision problems are easy, and great strategies are quickly deciphered and matched. When K is high, problems are complex, and a successful resolution of a decision problem may defy discovery for an exponen- tially long period. The generality of this result is worth emphasizing. It applies to any step-by-step search procedure that one could write down. It encompasses procedures ranging from simple exhaustive search to sophisticated approaches that send “probes” into the landscape and react to the results. For K \u0006 2, the strategy decision problem is intrac- table in the technical sense of the word. The problem becomes intractable in the vernacular sense, however, only when two further conditions hold: the number of decisions N is substantial, and the time involved in each algorithmic step is not trivial. Some examples make this clear. When N \u0001 5 and a proposed strategy can be evaluated in an hour, for example, a very simple algorithm—exhaustive search—will pinpoint the global optimum in a mere 2 5 \u0001 32 hours. When N grows to 20, however, the solution time associated with exhaustive search rises to 120 years. Table 1 shows the time required for exhaustive search to discover the global optimum under various combina-\n\ntions of N and evaluation time per strategy. (Evalua- tion time reﬂects either the time required to conduct a study of an alternative strategy or the time necessary to implement a test and receive feedback.) Only when N is very low and the evaluation time very brief does exhaustive search appear practical. The NP -completeness result alone does not imply that complexity deters imitation. The result ensures only that complexity undermines global optimization . When facing a complex decision problem, thoughtful managers presumably understand the futility of try- ing to “solve” the problem and match the performance of a benchmark ﬁrm by any algorithmic means. Rather, they likely use simple heuristics and attempt to learn directly from the successful ﬁrm. The remain- ing challenge, then, is to show that complexity also undermines the heuristics and attempts at learning. Sections 4 and 5 tackle this challenge. The NP -completeness result suggests interpreta- tions for two phenomena that are unrelated to imita- tion. First, it is commonly posited that managers satisﬁce rather than optimize (e.g., March and Simon 1958, Nelson and Winter 1982). Satisﬁcing seems a sensible course of action if the strategy formulation problem is NP -complete; managers have little choice but to use heuristics and judgment to seek good, albeit not necessarily optimal, conﬁgurations of decisions. Second, the NP -completeness ﬁnding suggests that in complex settings, some very good strategies may go undiscovered for long periods. Thus a successful new way of doing business may emerge “out of the blue”\n\nTable 1 Time Required for Exhaustive Search\n\nTime required to evaluate one possible strategy\n\n1 second 1 hour 1 day 1 year\n\nN \u0001 5 32 seconds 32 hours 32 days 32 years N \u0001 10 17 minutes 43 days 2.8 years \u0007 1,000 years N \u0001 20 12.1 days 120 years \u0007 3,000 years \u0007 1 million years N \u0001 30 34 years \u0007 120,000 years \u0007 3 million years \u0007 1 billion years N \u0001 40 \u0007 35,000 years \u0007 125 million years \u0007 3 billion years \u0007 1 trillion years\n\nDescription .

Finally, the NP -completeness of the strategy formu- lation problem poses a question for the recent, impor- tant stream of research on complementarities (e.g., Milgrom and Roberts 1990, 1995; Topkis 1998 and references therein). Like this paper, the complementa- rity research drops the assumption, often made by economists, that managers must make only a handful of decisions. It also emphasizes the role played by interactions among choice variables. In contrast to this paper, however, the complementarities research is interested primarily in comparative statics: how do optimal sets of decisions concerning complementary variables shift as underlying parameters change? Con- sider, for instance, the array of decisions which an auto manufacturer must make concerning price, ma- chine ﬂexibility, product variety, the length of produc- tion runs, inventory, vertical integration, and human resource practices. How does the best set of decisions shift as exogenous factors change—say, as the costs of data communication, computation, and ﬂexible ma- chines fall? The power of the complementarity approach is that it identiﬁes the weakest conditions under which one can say anything about such questions. Roughly, Topkis, Milgrom and Roberts, and others show that one can make clean comparative static predictions if and only if the auto maker’s proﬁt \u0004 ( x , p ) is super- modular in decision variables x and outside parame- ters p . That is, the marginal return to increasing any variable must increase with any other variable, for all values of all other variables. Under those conditions, the optimal choice x \u0001 ( p ) is monotone nondecreasing in p . Milgrom and Roberts (1990) use these results to show how declining costs of communication, comput- ers, and ﬂexible machines could prompt an optimizing ﬁrm to lower prices, invest in ﬂexible production, broaden product lines, shorten production runs, re- duce inventory, buy inputs rather than make them, and adopt team-based human resource practices. The NP -completeness result, however, illustrates a situation in which interactions among numerous de- cisions make the global optimum difﬁcult to ﬁnd. This\n\nraises a dilemma concerning the comparative static result: is it appropriate to focus on the global optimum when that optimum might be very hard to discover? How relevant are comparative statics when optimiza- tion might be a poor model of behavior? The dilemma is eased, to a certain extent, by the fact that Milgrom and Roberts et al. examine comparative statics only for supermodular functions, in which an increase in each decision variable always raises the incremental returns to all others. ( NK landscapes are much more general. With a payoff function generated by the NK model, altering a decision may increase or decrease the incremental returns to another decision, and the sign of the effect may depend on the choices made concerning other decisions.) Finding a good set of decisions on a supermodular landscape is, in certain senses, easier than ﬁnding one on a general NK landscape. On a supermodular landscape, for in- stance, one can test whether a candidate point is a global optimum by surveying just the two orthants above and below the candidate (Milgrom and Roberts 1995, p. 185); on a general landscape, one would have to consider all 2 N orthants. Starting at any point on a supermodular landscape, a ﬁrm that scours only those two orthants is sure to get at least half of the gains that an exhaustive search would yield (Milgrom and Rob- erts 1995, p. 185); on a general landscape, such a limited search might produce none of the gains. For particular restricted classes of problems with super- modular payoff functions, polynomial-time algo- rithms are known to exist. (Speciﬁcally, the ellipsoid method can solve problems involving supermodular set functions in polynomial time (Gro¨tschel et al. 1988, Chapter 10).) Although the structure imposed by supermodularity makes global optimization easier, it by no means makes it easy. The time required to survey two orthants may easily rise exponentially with the size of a problem. Polynomial-time algorithms are not known to exist for most types of problems with supermodular payoff func- tions. Even when they do exist, they can be very time- consuming: “theoretically efﬁcient” but not “practically efﬁcient” (Gro¨tschel et al. 1988, Chapter 3). In sum, before applying comparative static results in situations involving sets of interactive variables,\n\nRIVKIN Imitation of Complex Strategies\n\n834 Management Science /Vol. 46, No. 6, June 2000\n\nDownloaded from informs.org by [2a01:4b00:ad0a:5000:f0af:cb7e:c1e:4fc5] on 31 August 2023, at 23:25 .

This is more likely to be true when the number of decisions involved is modest; when little time is required to evaluate a candidate solution; when interactions are sparse; when search is permitted for a long period; and when a large number of ﬁrms are tackling the decision problem. Supermodularity imposes some structure that aids in ﬁnding good solutions, but it does not guarantee that the global optimum will be found readily.\n\n4. Imitation by Incremental Improvement This section and the next turn to heuristic-based imitation. I begin with the plight of the incremental improver. I use simulation to show how strategic complexity undercuts such a ﬁrm’s ability to approach the benchmark ﬁrm. Prior to a full-scale simulation, however, I discuss two structural features of land- scapes that bode ill for the incremental improvement effort.\n\n4.1. Structural Deterrents to Incremental Improvement Consider a rival that hopes to replicate the benchmark ﬁrm’s success by making a series of incremental, single-decision improvements ( M \u0001 1). As the under- lying decision problem becomes complex—as N and K rise—the rival’s prospects worsen for two structural reasons.\n\nMany Peaks. First, the number of local peaks on which the imitator may get trapped rises rapidly with N and K . When K \u0001 0, there exists only one peak regardless of N . Facing such a decision problem, the incremental imitator will surely replicate the high performer’s strategy eventually. At the other extreme, K \u0001 N \u0002 1, the elevations of adjacent strategies are fully uncorrelated. Of the 2 N possible strategies, 2 N /( N \b 1) are expected to be local peaks (Kauffman 1993, p. 47). This number is large for even modest N . For N \u0001 20, for instance, the typical K \u0001 N \u0002 1 landscape has nearly 50,000 local optima. On such terrain, the incremental improver will almost surely\n\nget snared on a local peak rather than make its way to the benchmark strategy. The multiplicity of peaks is not quite so daunting when K is less than N \u0002 1, but it remains very large. For various values of N and K , I release 100 ﬁrms at random locations on a landscape and allow them to edge uphill by single-decision improvements. Table 2 reports the number of distinct local peaks that the ﬁrms discover. When N and K are low, only a handful of peaks exist, and all 100 ﬁrms gravitate toward them. When N and K are high, nearly every ﬁrm reaches its own local peak. Note that both aspects of complexity are necessary for local peaks to proliferate.\n\nLow Peaks. The multiplicity of peaks on rough terrain would not be harmful to imitators if those peaks were highly proﬁtable. It turns out, however, that not only do local peaks proliferate as K rises, but the “average” peak sinks. For the extreme cases of K \u0001 0 and K \u0001 N \u0002 1, average peak height is easily calculated using order statistics and the Central Limit Theorem. As shown in Table 3, N has no effect on peak elevation when decisions are independent of one another ( K \u0001 0). In contrast, when interactions are pervasive ( K \u0001 N \u0002 1), increasing N causes the expected peak height to fall. In the large- N limit, ﬁrm value on a local peak declines to 0.5, which is no better than the value expected from a randomly selected set of choices. Calculating the heights of local optima is\n\nTable 2 Number of Distinct Peaks Discovered by 100 Firms\n\nK \u0001 0 K \u0001 1 K \u0001 3 K \u0001 7 K \u0001 11\n\nN \u0001 4 1.0 1.9 3.3 (0.0) (0.2) (0.4) N \u0001 8 1.0 2.4 8.6 23.5 (0.0) (0.5) (0.7) (0.7) N \u0001 12 1.0 5.1 20.2 55.6 80.4 (0.0) (1.1) (1.2) (1.2) (1.1) N \u0001 24 1.0 15.1 68.8 97.8 99.6 (0.0) (1.8) (1.5) (0.4) (0.2)\n\nDescription .

Weinberger (1991), however, succeeds in doing so via the Central Limit Theorem and a series of approximations. He ﬁnds that for values of K that are large but possibly much less than N , the heights of local peaks are asymptotically normally distributed with approxi- mate mean \u0005 \u0001 1\n\n2 \b ln( K \b 1)/6( K \b 1). Note that d \u0005 / dK 0 for K \u0006 2 and lim K 3 \u0005 \u0001 1\n\n2 . For large K , the typical local optimum on which an incremental imitator gets trapped corresponds to mediocre perfor- mance. As the web of conﬂicting constraints thickens, opportunities for incremental improvement can van- ish even at low levels of performance.\n\n4.2. Simulation Results The structural features suggest that incremental im- provement will fail in the face of complexity. Simula- tions conﬁrm that this is the case. To provide a polar case, I set M , the number of decisions modiﬁed in each incremental step, to 1. For various values of N and K , 500 imitators are released on each of ten landscapes and allowed to “tweak” uphill until encountering a (possibly local) peak. Table 4 reports the results of this process. Panel A records the portion of incremental imitators that meet or exceed the performance of the benchmark strategy. The table also gives the gap between the benchmark strategy and the highest point found by the typical imitator. This gap is measured in terms of both ﬁrm value (panel B) and distance in decision space (panel C). As expected, when K \u0001 0 incremental improve- ment always delivers the imitator to the single (global)\n\nTable 3 Expected Height of a Local Peak\n\nN \u0007 1 K \u0001 0 K \u0001 N \b 1\n\n10 0.667 0.648 20 0.667 0.624 30 0.667 0.610 40 0.667 0.600 50 0.667 0.593 100 0.667 0.573\n\nDescription .

By the N \u0001 24, K \u0001 11 case, only 37 of the 5,000 imitators match the bench- mark. Local peaks become numerous and the typical imitator gets stranded well below and far away from the best strategy. Panel B highlights the crucial role played by K , relative to N . It is the interaction among numerous decisions, not the mere proliferation of decisions, that harms the incremental improver. Table 5 examines the evolution of the benchmark under the incremental improvement heuristic. For each level of N and K , one thousand ﬁrms are released sequentially on each of 20 landscapes, and each ﬁrm exhausts its opportunities for local improvement. Panel A records the number of times that a new ﬁrm establishes a new, higher standard for performance. Panel B reports the number of times that a new ﬁrm matches (but does not exceed) the existing benchmark. Panel C analyzes the number of ﬁrms released before each new benchmark is matched or exceeded; i.e., it measures how long each new benchmark remains unbeaten. New, superior strategies are discovered more frequently on complex landscapes (panel A), and such strategies are far more rarely matched in complex settings (panel B). Consequently, benchmark ﬁrms have much longer runs of success when deci- sions are numerous and intertwined (panel C).\n\n5. Imitation by Following the Leader Surely, one might argue, incremental improvement is a poor caricature of the imitation process. An imitator does not try to match a successful rival solely by making uninformed, local “tweaks” to its own choices. Rather, it observes the high performer closely: reverse- engineers its products, interviews its customers and former employees, speaks with its suppliers, dissects its public literature, benchmarks its every activity, and so forth. Once well informed, the imitator changes a large number of its choices—leaps in decision space toward the conﬁguration of the successful ﬁrm—in hope of landing somewhere near the proﬁtable strat- egy. From there, it edges uphill. Complexity makes this style of imitation less effec-\n\ntive, just as it undermines incremental improvement. I discuss two structural reasons for this, then turn to an integrated simulation.",

Nonetheless, the would-be imitator hopes that it will come close enough to the successful set of deci- sions that subsequent “tweaks” will take it to the peak. Such a wholesale reconﬁguration is successful only if the imitator’s leap lands in the basin of attraction below the high performer’s peak. Unfortunately for the imitator, complexity under- mines its leap. When decisions are numerous and richly cross-coupled, the attraction basins of high peaks become small, and the odds of jumping into them grow correspondingly poor. To see this, consider the extreme cases of K \u0001 0 and K \u0001 N \u0002 1, with M \u0001 1. For K \u0001 0, of course, the basin of attraction of the global peak is the entire landscape regardless of N , and incremental improvements will take a ﬁrm from any set of choices to the best conﬁguration. The accuracy of a long jump is irrelevant. For K \u0001 N \u0002 1, however, the situation is very different. Consider the global peak, which typically has among the broadest basins of attraction. The portion of points from which a ﬁrm can tweak its way to the global peak dwindles rapidly with N . The basin of the global peak covers only 7% of the landscape when N \u0001 8, K \u0001 7, and less than 0.5% when N \u0001 16, K \u0001 15.\n\nSpreading Peaks. The problem of the dwindling basins would not be so vexing for would-be copycats if high peaks on the landscape clustered together. If peaks lay in “mountain ranges,” then an imitator would, on average, ﬁnd a long jump toward a high performer beneﬁcial even if it failed to land in pre- cisely the right basin of attraction. The imitator might not wind up atop Mount Everest, but at least it would be in the Himalayas. Once again, however, interactions work against the imitator. As K increases, peaks on the landscape spread apart . This effect is illustrated in Figure 2. For N \u0001 24 and various values of K , I release 100 ﬁrms and allow them to move uphill incrementally until they discover local peaks. For each peak, Figure 2 plots two items against one another: (1) the height of the peak, and (2)\n\nits distance in decision space from the highest peak found on the landscape. For N \u0001 24 and K \u0001 1, note the strong negative correlation. The higher peaks tend to be near “Everest” and the lower peaks far away. As K rises, the correlation fades and high peaks spread apart. The location of a high peak carries less and less information about where other high summits can be found. The intuition behind this is straightforward. When choices are loosely connected, the strategy of a suc- cessful ﬁrm can typically be decomposed into separa- ble subsystems of well-made choices (Simon 1962). Reconﬁguring one of the subsystems has limited effect on the others and generates a new local peak that is quite close in decision space to the original one. The mountain range around Everest consists of Everest- like decision conﬁgurations with individual sub- systems modiﬁed. In contrast, when choices are tightly interlocked, the strategy of a successful ﬁrm cannot be broken into subsystems. High peaks are then likely to be altogether different ways of doing business rather than slight variations on a theme. When interactivity is strong, slight variations destroy the theme. Note the special role played by K in determining these structural features. Never does an increase in N alone, the mere number of decisions a ﬁrm faces, impede imitators. Both structural obstacles discussed here (as well as the two considered in §4.1) hinge crucially on K . Interactions, then, are at the core of the imitation barrier proposed in this paper. High values of N are important in deterring imitation largely because they create rich opportunities for interactions.\n\n5.2. Simulation Results Simulations conﬁrm what the structural features pro- pose: complexity makes follow-the-leader imitation less successful. Recall the key parameters governing the search processes: J , the number of decisions recon- ﬁgured in a leap toward the benchmark, and \u0002 , the probability that each of the J decisions will be imitated correctly in the reorientation. First consider reorientations in isolation. As in §4.2, I release 500 imitators on each of ten landscapes, but now allow them to “leap” in decision space toward the benchmark strategy. Of course, when J \u0001 N and \u0002 \u0001 1,\n\nRIVKIN Imitation of Complex Strategies\n\n838 Management Science /Vol. 46, No. 6, June 2000\n\nDownloaded from informs.org by [2a01:4b00:ad0a:5000:f0af:cb7e:c1e:4fc5] on 31 August 2023, at 23:25 .

However, even a small departure of \u0002 from 1 to 0.9 creates a substantial problem for the imitator when the underlying decision problem is complex (Table 6). For high N and K , the typical imitator is much worse off than the benchmark ﬁrm (panel B). Note the interplay between N and K . As N grows, the likelihood that the imitator will accurately replicate all of the benchmark ﬁrm’s decisions without a single mistake ( \u0002 N ) declines (panel A). As K in- creases, the impact of each mistake rises (panel B). A high N makes errors likely, while a high K makes errors matter. In a strategy whose pieces are numerous and tightly knit, small probabilities that each element will be replicated incorrectly cumulate to produce a\n\nhigh likelihood that imitators will fare poorly. Once again, panel B emphasizes the role of K , not N alone, in making the imitator worse off. Next, I couple follow-the-leader and incremental search. The imitator’s hope here is that the two modes of search will work together to overcome complexity: a reconﬁguration will position the ﬁrm in the valley beneath a good strategy, and subsequent incremental improvement will achieve that strategy. Given enough cycles of following the leader and improving incre- mentally, the imitator will (almost) surely match the benchmark ﬁrm. It turns out, however, that the time required to do so may be lengthy. As results avail- able from the author show, the median number of periods required for imitation to succeed is an order of\n\nFigure 2 Spreading of Peaks for N \u0001 24\n\nDescription . For N \u0001 24 and various values of K , 100 ﬁrms were released on a landscape and allowed to tweak uphill, one decision at a time, until reaching a local peak. Each gray point represents a local peak discovered in this fashion. The point shows the height of the peak and the “strategic distance” of the peak from the highest discovered on the landscape. The strategic distance between two peaks is deﬁned as the number of decisions made differently in the two strategies that constitute the peaks. This ﬁgure was inspired by Kauffman (1993), ﬁg. 2.7.\n\nInterpretation . For low K , the higher peaks tend to be nearer the highest peak.

For each level of N and K shown here, ten landscapes were generated. One each landscape, a benchmark strategy was pinpointed as the best of 100 exploratory searches. Five hundred imitators were then released on each landscape with randomly assigned initial strategies and were allowed to attempt a “long jump.” That is, each imitator tried to replicate the N decisions of the benchmark ﬁrm, with a \u0002 \u0001 90% chance of success on each decision. The panels address various questions regarding the imitators’ performance. Each data point is the average over the ten landscapes, and the standard deviation of the average is shown in parentheses below each data point. Interpretation . Follow-the-leader efforts become ineffective as the underlying decision problem grows complex.

Robustness of the Results It is notoriously difﬁcult to demonstrate the robust- ness of simulation results conclusively. This is true because the space of possible model speciﬁcations and parameter values is vast, far too large to explore by exhaustive search. Nonetheless, several features of §§3–5 should reassure the reader that the main result, that complexity deters imitation, is robust. First, the analytical techniques employed from algorithm the- ory do not rely on simulation. Second, the reported results are averages over large numbers of simulation trials. Third, the simulations span the full range of parameter values permitted by a state-of-the-art per- sonal computer. Fourth, the simulations explore a variety of search heuristics. Fifth and ﬁnally, the discussion tries to elucidate the structural features that give rise to the simulation results, and the intuition behind those features, before it turns to simulation. An appendix available on request subjects the model to a further battery of robustness tests. The results are not sensitive to the arbitrary assumption that contributions C i are drawn from a U [0, 1] distri- bution. Nor are they sensitive to the assumptions that the K decisions affecting each C i are assigned at random and that all decisions are equally inﬂuential ex ante. I also consider three alternative ways to identify the benchmark strategy: as the globally opti- mal strategy; as the highest point discovered in an exhaustive search over a ﬁxed fraction of the land- scape; and as the highest point discovered in an exhaustive search over a ﬁxed number of strategies. In all cases, complexity makes imitators worse off, and results are largely comparable to those reported here. The result of virtually any model can be shaken, however, if one alters the model dramatically enough. An important question is, what are the least extreme modiﬁcations that undo the main result? In exploring the model under a wide range of conditions, I noted three modiﬁcations that neutralize complexity as an obstacle to imitation. First, the barrier to follow-the- leader imitation disappears if imitators understand the high performer’s strategy thoroughly and can\n\nreplicate it precisely ( \u0002 \u0001 1). Second, the barrier posed by complexity declines as incremental imitators are allowed to search more broadly ( M \u0006 1). Though diminished, the barrier remains so long as M N . When imitators are permitted global search ( M \u0001 N ), the barrier disappears altogether. Similarly, and as noted in §3.3, the NP -completeness result loses its force if imitators can evaluate alternative strategies very rapidly and N is modest. Exhaustive search then becomes practical. Of these three conditions, the one that seems most likely to arise in reality is that N , the number of decisions over which managers have true latitude, is limited. This might occur, for example, if managerial choice is rigidly constrained by national institutions.\n\n7. Conclusion The complexity of a strategy, coupled with limits on what managers know about rivals and can implement, raises a barrier to imitation. When the decisions that embody a strategy are numerous and tightly linked to one another, a ﬁrm that discovers an effective combi- nation of choices is protected against imitation in three ways. First, interactions among the decisions make the strategy formulation problem intractable. When the number of decisions is large and strategy evaluation is time consuming, this undermines any logical, algo- rithmic attempt to rediscover the high performer’s strategy. Second, a would-be imitator that tries to match the successful strategy by incremental improve- ment will soon ﬁnd itself snared in a web of conﬂicting constraints. Finally, a would-be imitator that attempts to match the high performer’s entire system, via a wholesale reconﬁguration, is also likely to fail. Sup- pose it succeeds in imitating most of the high perform- er’s decisions but misses on a handful. Then because the decisions’ effects are tightly knit together, the overall imitation attempt will probably be a failure. Due to the complexity barrier to imitation, success- ful strategies may remain unmatched even though they are open to public scrutiny and even after many of their critical ingredients are adopted by competi- tors. This may help to explain the persistent superior performance of certain ﬁrms, as mentioned in §1. It may also shed light on the slow diffusion of complex\n\nRIVKIN Imitation of Complex Strategies\n\nManagement Science /Vol. 46, No. 6, June 2000 841\n\nDownloaded from informs.org by [2a01:4b00:ad0a:5000:f0af:cb7e:c1e:4fc5] on 31 August 2023, at 23:25 .

There may be some truth in the popular business wisdom that the whole of a strategy can resist imitation more effectively than the sum of its parts. The analysis is also consistent with Sorenson’s (1997) ﬁnding that tight coupling confers a contempo- raneous advantage on computer workstation makers. Sorenson takes vertical integration as a proxy for the extent of interaction across decisions ( K ) and ﬁnds that more integrated organizations have a lower mor- tality rate at a point in time. His interpretation is that integration allows ﬁrms to realize operating efﬁcien- cies, exploit market power, tap synergies across verti- cal stages, or reduce uncertainty. It is also possible, however, that tight integration is advantageous be- cause it protects a successful workstation maker from copycats. In addition to illuminating well-established pat- terns, the analysis suggests new empirical ﬁngerprints that complexity might leave behind. Where decisions are numerous and interconnected, one expects imita- tion attempts to be less successful, and perhaps less common, than they are where strategies are relatively simple. This suggests that the distribution of ﬁrm performance will be broader and convergence to mean performance will be slower in settings with more complex strategies. Indeed, industries differ substan- tially in the range of performance levels they exhibit and in their speed of convergence (Waring 1996), and conventional industrial organization variables explain these cross-industry differences incompletely. A nat- ural hypothesis is that proxies for industry complexity would help to explain the residual differences. The impediment to imitation I propose arises purely from the character of the decision problem and the nature of search. It owes nothing to the game-theoretic considerations or resource barriers that have domi-\n\nnated recent analyses of imitation. My claim is not that other barriers to imitation are unimportant. Indeed, strategic complexity ampliﬁes many of those barriers (and vice versa). Suppose, for instance, that lack of some piece of tacit knowledge prevents a would-be imitator from matching one of the benchmark ﬁrm’s decisions. The damage this does to the copycat is greater if the affected decision interacts widely with many other choices than if it is isolated. A small misstep is more dangerous on rugged terrain than on a smooth surface. 5\n\nThough complementary in some ways to game- theoretic and resource-based views of strategy, a focus on complexity does lead one to an unconventional view of what choices are “strategic.” Traditionally, strategy scholars have paid closest attention to inher- ently irreversible choices with large performance im- plications (e.g., Ghemawat 1991). In the present paper, however, it is difﬁcult to label any isolated decision as strategic. No single choice is innately sticky. What does appear strategic by traditional standards is the choice of a particular logic of conﬁguration, a local peak. The stickiness of individual choices is then endogenous; once a ﬁrm adopts a speciﬁc conﬁgura- tion or peak, changes in individual choices become costly. Likewise, the consequences of individual deci- sions become large because they undermine the effec-\n\n5 Among the imitation barriers associated with the resource-based view of the ﬁrm, the nearest relative to complexity is “causal ambiguity.” Lippman and Rumelt (1982) argue on logical grounds that a basic ambiguity concerning causal connections between actions and results can make imitation an uncertain venture. They then show how uncertainty in imitation can lead to persistent performance differences and above-normal rates of return despite free entry, proﬁt-maximizing behavior, no scale economies, and no market power. They never explain, however, the roots of causal ambiguity, nor do they specify how it deters imitation. The complex- ity explored here can certainly underlie causal ambiguity. When a winning strategy consists of numerous, interlocking decisions, it is nearly impossible to assign credit for any part of the success to any isolated choice. Success arises from the whole, not the parts, so cause and effect are blurred. On the other hand, complexity can deter imitation even when causal ambiguity is altogether absent. This arises, for instance, if the managers of the would-be imitator understand causal connections perfectly but have imperfect control over internal operations. Hence, complexity may underpin causal ambiguity, but it may also operate independently of ambiguity.\n\nRIVKIN Imitation of Complex Strategies\n\n842 Management Science /Vol. 46, No. 6, June 2000\n\nDownloaded from informs.org by [2a01:4b00:ad0a:5000:f0af:cb7e:c1e:4fc5] on 31 August 2023, at 23:25 .

Recent research on complemen- tary bundles of organizational practices gives at least some evidence that this occurs. The world depicted in this paper could lead one to a fatalistic view of management: seemingly minor decisions can be salient, relationships among decisions are thoroughly unknown a priori, algorithmic analysis of decision problems is doomed, and reasonable heu- ristics leave ﬁrms trapped in webs of conﬂicting constraints. What role is there, then, for management science or managerial choice in a complex world? My belief is that major roles remain. I highlight two. First, the analysis in this paper should make clear the power and importance of anticipating the relation- ships among decisions. An imitator who understands that a particular pair of choices should always be adjusted in unison effectively reduces the number of decisions and the number of interactions that she must actively consider. As the numerical results make clear, modest reductions in the dimensionality of the deci- sion problem can make imitation signiﬁcantly easier. Even an understanding that certain variables usually, though not always, move together can be powerful. This is one reason that recent work on complementa- rity and supermodularity have generated such inter- est. As discussed in §3, the structure imposed by supermodularity can greatly simplify managerial search. This also helps to explain recurring efforts to classify strategies into a manageable number of ge- neric types (e.g., Miles and Snow 1978, Porter 1980). Such taxonomies hold out the hope that only a hand- ful of coherent sets of choices exist. If true, this simpliﬁes the managerial search problem dramati- cally. Empirical support for taxonomies is mixed (e.g., Miller and Dess 1993), suggesting that they may simplify decision problems too much. An important role of management science is to isolate relationships that truly, reliably exist among decisions and thereby to simplify decision problems (without simplifying them falsely). Analyses in the paper also hint at the potency of altering the relationships among decisions. In the for- mal models described here, managers take N and K as\n\nimmutable. In reality, managers make investments to build connections across decisions or to sever links, i.e., to modularize (Baldwin and Clark 2000). Hence a successful ﬁrm might build new and elaborate connec- tions between, say, its production and marketing operations in order to fend off imitators. Alternatively, an imitator may try to break a successful strategy into discrete pieces and attack each piece in turn. A ﬁrm might expand its scope of operations, increasing N , or focus on a portion of the total value chain, reducing N . In altering the complexity of its strategy, a ﬁrm will face the tension identiﬁed in §1: a more modular, less coupled system adjusts more readily to environmental change and is less subject to inertia (Levinthal 1997, Sorenson 1997), but it is more easily attacked by imitators. Baldwin and Clark (2000) observe precisely this tension in the evolution of the computer industry. By adopting modular architectures in the mainframe industry and later in the personal computer market, IBM made itself and its products far more responsive to market needs. This approach, however, allowed widespread entry by imitators. Loosely coupled orga- nizations, it appears, are responsive to change, but vulnerable to imitation. A natural implication, worthy of further research, is that designers of organizations must decide which they fear more: inertia or imita- tion. 6\n\n6 I am grateful to George Baker, Pankaj Ghemawat, Tarun Khanna, Daniel Levinthal, and Michael Porter for especially incisive com- ments and to Howard Brenner for computer-programming wiz- ardry.

This paper explores this proposition rigorously. A simple model is developed that parametrizes the two aspects of strategic complexity: the number of elements in a strategy and the interactions among those elements. The model excludes conventional resource-based and game-theoretic barriers to imitation altogether. The model is used to show that complexity makes the search for an optimal strategy intractable in the technical sense of the word provided by the theory of NP-completeness. Consequently, would-be copycats must rely on search heuristics or on learning, not on algorithmic “solutions,” to match the performance of superior ﬁrms. However, complexity also undermines heuristics and learning. In the face of complexity, ﬁrms that follow simple hill-climbing heuristics are quickly snared on low “local peaks,” and ﬁrms that try to learn and mimic a high performer’s entire strategy suffer large penalties from small errors. The model helps to explain why some winning strategies remain unmatched even though they are open to public scrutiny; why certain bundles of organizational practices diffuse slowly even though they lead to superior performance; and why some strategies yield superior returns even after many of their critical ingredients are adopted by competitors. The analysis also suggests roles for management science and managerial choice in a world of complex strategies. ( Imitation ; Complexity ; Interactions ; Competitive Advantage )",

The actions of imitators promote the rapid diffusion of new prod- ucts, processes, and organizational arrangements. The prospect of imitation may dull the incentive to inno- vate, but actual imitation may spur past innovators on to fresh invention (Schumpeter 1942). Rapid imitation, it has been argued, reduces the proﬁtability of an industry, the degree to which production is concen- trated in a few hands, and the ability of successful ﬁrms to maintain productivity advantages (Nelson and Winter 1982, Porter 1980). Accordingly, the strategists of successful ﬁrms seek to deter imitation. Empirical evidence suggests that at",

Particu- larly striking is the ability of some ﬁrms to resist imitation despite extensive public scrutiny of their strategies.

      "paragraph_text": "What prevents the imitation of well-known, win- ning business strategies? Past research focuses on two classes of barriers to imitation. Proponents of the resource-based view of the ﬁrm highlight factors that make imitation difﬁcult: impediments to factor accu- mulation, social complexity, causal ambiguity, tacit knowledge, economies of scale and scope, adjustment costs, and ﬁrst-mover advantages (e.g., Barney 1991, Dierickx and Cool 1989, Lippman and Rumelt 1982). Industrial economists, in contrast, emphasize moves by incumbents that make imitation unrewarding, even if it is fully feasible. In many game-theoretic models, for instance, incumbent ﬁrms undertake costly commit- ments that alter their own future incentives, make retal- iation threats credible, and thereby fend off copycats. This paper offers a sharply different explanation for inimitability. I propose, and argue formally, that the sheer complexity of a strategy can raise a barrier to imitation . In my formulation, two factors make a strategy complex: the number of decisions that com- prise the strategy and the degree of interaction among those decisions (Simon 1962). As the elements of a ﬁrm’s decision problem grow numerous and interde- pendent, imitation of a successful strategy becomes very difﬁcult. Indeed it can become “intractable” in a technical sense of the word. Hence, a ﬁrm can deter imitation by doing a large number of related things well even if none of its individual actions is inimitable. Because of interactions among the components of a strategy, a would-be imitator could understand most of the ingredients that make up a successful business system yet still fail to grasp the recipe. Although this paper provides the ﬁrst formal anal- ysis of complexity as a barrier to imitation, there are ample precedents—theoretical, empirical, and clini- cal—for the notion that complexity deters imitation. Theoretical precedents come, in part, from the litera- ture on knowledge management. (In this line of re- search, the object of imitation is typically a product or a process, not a business strategy, but the insights are still relevant.) Conceptual discussions of knowledge management argue that complex knowledge is hard to transfer. Authors differ, however, in how they deﬁne “complex knowledge.” To Winter (1987), complexity reﬂects “the amount of information required to char-",

Tyre (1991) gauges complexity by “the number, nov- elty, and technological sophistication of new features and improved concepts introduced” in an innovation, while MacMillan et al. (1985) consider a new product complex if it “requires extensive reorganization of interdependent procedures and/or the coordination of many skills and multiple departments.” The deﬁni- tion of complexity which I adopt from Simon (1962) encompasses the two major concepts from the knowl- edge management literature: the sheer number of elements in an item of knowledge and the degree of interaction among those elements. The proposal that complexity can deter imitation also draws theoretical support from the extensive, though diffuse, research on loosely and tightly cou- pled systems. This line of inquiry has focused not on imitation, but on the more general topic of change. Students of both biological systems (e.g., Glassman 1973) and organizations (e.g., Weick 1976) have noted that systems whose elements are tightly coupled to one another ﬁnd it difﬁcult to learn and adapt to environmental change. Extensive interaction across elements can immobilize systems in general, just as they do the imitators in the analyses presented in this paper. Among the research efforts on change in cou- pled systems, the recent work of Levinthal (1997) is particularly pertinent because it employs an analytical framework very similar to the one I use below. The concerns motivating this paper and Levinthal’s are distinct: Levinthal emphasizes the interplay between organizational adaptation and population-level selec- tion forces while I examine the process of imitation. While I show how tight coupling among elements of a strategy protects a successful ﬁrm from imitation, Levinthal identiﬁes a dark side of coupling: successful ﬁrms with tightly coupled systems ﬁnd adaptation difﬁcult in the face of environmental change. To- gether, the papers illustrate a tension between the protective power and immobilizing inﬂuence of tight coupling. I return to this in the concluding section. Beyond theoretical precedents, a handful of empir- ical studies support the notion that complexity raises a",

      "paragraph_text": "barrier to imitation. In their analysis of the steel- ﬁnishing industry, Ichniowski et al. (1997) document a bundle of interwoven human resource practices that resists imitation. In a study of pharmaceutical re- search, Cockburn and Henderson (1996) show that many ﬁrms are slow to match the organizational practices of rivals that make science-driven R&D ef- fective. They attribute the inertia, in part, to “complex complementarities” among the practices. Examining commercial banking products, MacMillan et al. (1985) ﬁnd that imitation proceeds slowly when a new prod- uct entails interdependent procedures that span de- partment borders. Case studies of individual ﬁrms also suggest that highly complex strategies can with- stand imitation attempts. In their discussion of “ﬁt” and complementarity, Milgrom and Roberts (1995) suggest informally that rich interactions among Lin- coln Electric’s many choices may explain why rivals have not replicated that ﬁrm’s well-documented suc- cess. Porter (1996) argues that tight ﬁt among numer- ous activities helps companies such as Southwest Airlines, Vanguard, and Ikea stave off copycats. More casually, discussions in popular business circles com- monly claim that some inability to “get the whole system right” stymies imitators. Though the proposition that complexity deters im- itation has numerous precedents, a formal analysis of the proposal is worthwhile. The analysis highlights, for instance, how interaction among the elements of a strategy—not the mere proliferation of unrelated ele- ments—makes imitation difﬁcult. It pinpoints the type of interaction that stymies copycats: interactions that apply in all business situations (e.g., a complex prod- uct line always necessitates a highly trained sales force) pose little challenge. Interactions that vary from one situation to another (e.g., a complex product line sometimes calls for a multidivisional structure) are far more problematic. The formal analysis identiﬁes gen- eral structural features that obstruct strategy making, and it allows us to talk with precision about the computational burden associated with a business strategy. It also allows us to see how great the time required to evaluate a strategy must be before com- plexity truly trips up copycats. The rigorous case for complexity as a barrier to",

      "paragraph_text": "imitation begins in § 2. There I construct a model in which (a) a ﬁrm must make decisions concerning multiple elements of its strategy, (b) the elements interact, and (c) all other barriers to imitation are absent. The model is an adaptation of a tool developed by Kauffman (1993) in the context of evolutionary biology and introduced into management science by Levinthal (1997). Critically, it parametrizes the two aspects of complexity: the number of elements in the strategy and the degree of interaction among them. This allows one to tune the degree of complexity and analyze how an increase in complexity affects the ease of imitation. I next show (§ 3) that interactions among decisions render the ﬁrm’s decision problem NP-complete, i.e., intractable to algorithmic solution. When interactions are pervasive, no general, step-by-step procedure ex- ists that can locate the globally optimal strategy quickly. Hence interactions among decisions play at least a crude role in determining the ease of imitation. When interactions are common and decision problems intractable, a ﬁrm that ﬁnds a good resolution of its problem can hope that it will be hard for others to discover its formula for success. If complexity renders global optimization intracta- ble, however, one must presume that thoughtful man- agers realize the nature of the challenge they face and opt not to attempt global optimization. Rather, they likely employ judgment and heuristics to ﬁnd good, albeit not necessarily optimal, sets of decisions (March and Simon 1958). Thus it is crucial that I show how complexity hampers not just global optimization, but also the heuristics that imitating ﬁrms plausibly em- ploy. Sections 4 and 5 demonstrate how complexity undermines reasonable forms of heuristic search. Sec- tion 6 discusses the robustness of the results, and a concluding section summarizes empirical and practi- cal implications.",

N is the ﬁrst aspect of complexity, the number of decisions that a ﬁrm faces. In the formal model, each of N decisions can be resolved in two ways. 1 Hence a particular strategy s , a conﬁguration of decisions, is a vector { s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s N }, with each decision s i set to either 0 or 1. Note that there are 2 N possible conﬁgu- rations of decisions. K controls the second aspect of complexity, the degree to which the decisions interact. The efﬁcacy of each decision is affected not only by the choice (0 or 1) made concerning that decision, but also by the choices regarding K other decisions. In the model, each decision i makes a contribution C i to overall ﬁrm value. C i depends not only on s i but also on how K other randomly assigned decisions are resolved: C i \u0001 C i ( s i ; s i 1 , . . . , s iK ). K ranges from 0 to N \u0002 1. When K \u0001 0, the contribution of each decision depends only on the choice made concerning that decision: C i \u0001 C i ( s i ).

Rather, they are searching a very-high-dimensional “decision space” for an optimal combination of choices. This suggests the following image of a landscape: each of N decisions constitutes a “horizontal” axis in a high-dimensional space, and each decision offers dif- ferent options. Resulting from each combination of choices is a value for the ﬁrm, which is plotted on the vertical axis. The goal of the strategy formulation process is to occupy a high spot on this landscape, i.e., to select a combination of choices that, together, pro- duce a great deal of value for the owners of the ﬁrm. As I discuss below, the interactions introduced by K cause the landscape to become rugged and multi- peaked, and this makes the search for a high peak profoundly more difﬁcult. Note that a “strategy” in this formulation is pre- cisely a complete conﬁguration of N decisions. Re- searchers adopt widely varying deﬁnitions of the term “strategy.” Whatever deﬁnition one adopts, however, a strategy is realized in the marketplace as a set of choices that inﬂuence organizational performance. Ac- cordingly, this paper focuses directly on sets of choices. The choices encompassed by the N decisions include elements that many researchers would con- sider organizational structure, not strategy per se. For that reason, some readers may prefer to interpret this paper as addressing the imitation of entire organiza- tional conﬁgurations (Miller et al. 1984) or organiza- tional forms (Levinthal 1997) rather than strategies.",

Decision problems are generated by a process that is random in two ways: the K decisions that affect a focal decision are assigned by chance, as is the contribution C i corresponding to a particular conﬁguration of ( s i ; s i 1 , . . . , s iK ). At ﬁrst it may seem odd that decision problems are generated randomly. Recall, however, that the objective is to determine how complexity affects the imitation process typically , not for a partic- ular decision problem. The best way to accomplish this is to generate at random a number of decision problems of a particular degree of complexity, deter- mine average behavior on this set, adjust the complex- ity, and repeat the process. The role of chance in the modeling procedure re- ﬂects an important implicit assumption. The N deci- sions are choices whose relationships are not known a priori. If it is universally true and known that, say, two choices always “go together,” then those two choices are treated as a single decision in this paper’s model.

In §3, I examine the computational burden associated with global optimi- zation on a typical landscape and show how that burden grows with strategic complexity. In §§4 and 5, I consider imitators that use simple heuristics to try to match a benchmark ﬁrm. The effectiveness of each heuristic is assessed by a series of Monte Carlo simu- lations. I begin the simulations by ﬁxing N and K . For a given level of N and K , a number of landscapes are generated. On each landscape, a high point, s \u0001 , is identiﬁed as the best outcome of 100 exploratory searches, and a benchmark ﬁrm is assigned this strat- egy. Five hundred would-be imitators are then re- leased at random initial locations on the landscape. That is, each is assigned an initial decision conﬁgura- tion, or strategy, by chance. Each imitator uses a heuristic to search for higher ground—better sets of decisions—and I record how successful the typical imitator is for that level of complexity. I then adjust N and K and repeat the process. This isolates how the complexity of the underlying decision problem makes the imitation heuristic more or less effective. Three forms of search heuristic are considered. Under the incremental improvement heuristic, an imitat- ing ﬁrm considers all alternative strategies that in- volve changing M or fewer of its current decisions. It accepts an alternative if and only if the alternative generates a higher payoff. Once it has adopted the new strategy, the imitator considers another incre- mental change, and so forth until the ﬁrm reaches a (possibly local) peak. The parameter M governs how local the search is. M \u0001 1 implies a polar version of local search, employed by researchers such as Levinthal (1997). M \u0001 N constitutes global search. Under follow-the-leader imitation , a ﬁrm at s attempts a major reconﬁguration toward s \u0001 . J of its N decisions are adjusted to match the benchmark ﬁrm’s choices. The probability that each decision is matched correctly is \u0002 \u0003 1. \u0002 is ordinarily less than 1, reﬂecting the fact that an imitator may not understand the benchmark ﬁrm’s operations perfectly, does not have full access to the template (Nelson and Winter 1982) provided by",

In contrast to a follow-the-leader imitator, an incre- mental improver is “imitating” the benchmark ﬁrm only in a weak sense of the word. An incremental improver does not use any information about the strategy of the benchmark ﬁrm actively. Rather, it operates under the hope that incremental improve- ment will lead it to rediscover the benchmark’s suc- cess. Hence the cognitive models underlying the two heuristics are very different. I also consider a third search heuristic, a hybrid in which a ﬁrm jumps toward the benchmark in follow- the-leader fashion, tweaks uphill to a local peak, jumps again if necessary, and so forth. This hybrid captures three aspects of reality. It recognizes that ﬁrms are capable of both major reorientations and incremental change (Miller et al. 1984). It models imitation as an on-going effort, not a one-shot attempt to mimic success. And it permits rivals to start their imitation attempts (after the initial leap) clustered around the benchmark rather than spread uniformly over the landscape. As noted above, the benchmark in each simulation is pinpointed by a series of exploratory searches. One hundred ﬁrms, released at random locations on the landscape, search for better strategies, and the top performer serves as a standard. In all cases, the search heuristic employed in the exploratory phase is the same as that used by the subsequent imitators. The results are robust with respect to the method used to determine the benchmark (§6). The primary simulation results of the paper exam- ine how well imitators match a benchmark ﬁrm. Additional results show how the benchmark itself evolves over time. Speciﬁcally, I release thousands of ﬁrms sequentially on unexplored landscapes, allow each ﬁrm to seek a successful strategy using one of the heuristics described above, and record when “leader- ship” in the market changes hands. The ﬁrst ﬁrm released on the landscape sets an initial benchmark for performance. The second ﬁrm may match that bench- mark, achieve a worse performance, or exceed the benchmark—in which case it sets a new benchmark. By repeating this analysis for various levels of N and",

The primary simulations reﬂect a mature business in which an imitator attempts to mimic a well-established leader. The additional simulations apply better to an emerging industry in which the standards for performance are still in ﬂux. It is important to note what the model excludes . Imitators face no costs of adjustment, no threats of retaliation from the incumbent high performer, no fear that colocation with the high performer will lead to intense competition, no second-mover disadvantages, no barriers to modifying individual decisions, no economies of scale or scope, and no impediments to resource accumulation. Search costs are set to zero; indeed, the incremental improver knows the value of all neighboring strategies within a radius of M per- fectly without cost or commitment. The real and important fact that some decisions are harder to change than others is purposely suppressed. In short, none of the conventional deterrents to imitation are present. Any barriers that imitators face derive purely from the complexity of the underlying decision prob- lem, coupled with modest limits on what the ﬁrm knows and can do.",

Antecedents in Evolutionary Biology Some readers will recognize the modeling approach as a modiﬁcation of the NK model developed by evolu- tionary biologist Stuart Kauffman and his colleagues (Kauffman 1993 and references therein). Kauffman devised the NK model in order to examine how biological entities such as proteins and organisms evolve. Just as managerial decision making can be conceived of as a hill-climbing search in a high- dimensional decision space for an internally consistent set of choices, so evolution has often been seen as a hunt in a high-dimensional genetic space for a peak combination of genes (Wright 1931). Of course, the biological analogy is not perfect. Managers can scan the strategies adopted by their rivals, learn from them, and purposely reconﬁgure their choices to match the competition. Mice, on the other hand, cannot modify their genetic makeup to be more elephantine, no matter how much they admire",

The particular process for generating landscapes and the use of simulation are taken, unmodiﬁed, from Kauffman (1993). As subsequent references make clear, the structural features of landscapes I discuss below are identiﬁed by Kauffman and other users of the NK model.

The informed follow-the-leader heuristic and the hybrid heuristic are new. Indeed, such purposeful search processes make little sense in the context of biological evolution. Similarly, the use of a benchmark toward which followers aim is an innovation. Kauff- man (1993) speculates on the computational burden imposed by the NK model but, since the agents in his models cannot devise algorithms, he need not prove the intractability of optimization as I do below.

Interactions and Landscape Ruggedness A crucial feature of the modeling approach is that, by means of K , it parametrizes the richness of interaction among the elements of the ﬁrm’s strategy. Much of the intuition concerning the effects of K depends on the following insight: as the pieces of a strategy become more interdependent, the landscape corresponding to a ﬁrm’s decision problem becomes increasingly rug- ged. That is, the correlation between the altitudes of adjacent points on the landscape—points that differ by how one decision is made—falls, and local peaks proliferate. In the biological context, Kauffman (1993, pp. 54–63) goes to great lengths to show that this is the case. Here I give two examples that provide some intuition concerning the link between K and landscape ruggedness.",

In this situation, alteration of a single decision changes the contribution of that decision alone. Adjacent locations on the terrain— conﬁgurations that differ by how a single decision is resolved—cannot differ in elevation by more than 1/ N , so the landscape is relatively smooth. Moreover, from any initial location on the landscape, ﬁrms can rise to the global peak via a series of value-improving, single-decision “tweaks.” Management simply adjusts each choice, one by one, to the option that allows that decision to make the greater contribution in isolation. Hence when K \u0001 0, one has a smooth landscape with a single peak whose basin of attraction is the entire decision space. In contrast, K \u0001 N \u0002 1 implies that every decision inﬂuences the contribution of every other choice. Then, a small step on the landscape—a change in a single decision—alters the value contributions of all N elements. Adjacent decision conﬁgurations have levels of value (elevations) that are altogether uncorrelated with one another, and the impact of a single decision is bounded above by 1 and below by \u0002 1. The land- scape is fully random with many local peaks. The landscapes considered here exist in such high- dimensional spaces that they cannot be depicted di- rectly, but random walks on typical landscapes can convey a sense of ruggedness. Figure 1 does this for N \u0001 24 and various values of K . As K rises, the landscape grows rugged, and the elevation at any step becomes a poor predictor of the elevation at the next step. The intuition of why interactions may deter imita- tion now begins to become clear. In a richly interactive system, global optimization is difﬁcult. In graphic terms, it is hard to pinpoint and scale the highest peak on rugged terrain. Incremental improvement is inef- fective. In enhancing the performance of one element of the system, managers may inadvertently under- mine other parts. The ﬁrm quickly becomes ensnared in a web of conﬂicting constraints. Graphically, the ﬁrm is trapped on a low local peak. A wholesale reconﬁguration might free the ﬁrm from the local peak and take it to a much higher location. Unfortunately, interactions also make such large-scale changes risky.",

The tractability of a particular problem hinges on its time complexity func- tion , which relates the size of a speciﬁc instance of a problem ( n ) to the time that a given algorithm re- quires to solve the problem ( t ( n )). An algorithm is any general, step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. A critical distinction exists between polynomial time algorithms, for which t is some polynomial function of n , and exponential time algorithms, for which t is an exponential function of n . This distinction is crucial because exponential functions grow far faster than polynomial functions. Algorithms with exponential time complexity become impractical for large in- stances while algorithms with polynomial time com- plexity remain feasible. Problems for which polyno- mial time algorithms exist are said to fall into the P class and are considered by algorithm designers to be well solved. Problems for which no polynomial time algorithms exist are labeled “intractable.” Deﬁnitively proving intractability, however, turns out to be difﬁcult, and this difﬁculty has led to two additional concepts: the NP class of problems and NP -completeness. Many problems for which no poly- nomial time algorithm has been found could, in the- ory, be solved in polynomial time if one had a “non- deterministic computer,” a machine with unlimited parallel processing capabilities. Such problems fall into the nondeterministic polynomial , or NP , class . P \u0002 NP . Moreover, it is widely believed (but not yet proven) that P \u0003 NP , i.e., there are NP problems with no polynomial time solutions. The NP - complete class of problems is a subset of NP problems which have been shown to be as hard as any in the NP class. Transfor- mations have been devised that permit one to convert each NP -complete problem into others in polynomial time. Therefore, if one could ﬁnd a polynomial time algorithm for any NP -complete problem, one could devise such an algorithm for all NP problems. Con- versely, if any problem in the NP class is intractable, all NP -complete problems are intractable. Hundreds of problems have now been shown to fall into the NP -complete class (Garey and Johnson 1979). It is widely believed, though not yet proven, that the NP -complete problems are all intractable. In all like- lihood, no general , step-by-step procedure can be devised to",

Suppose a group of managers faces a decision problem, an NK landscape, whose topography is unknown. Given some time, the managers can correctly evaluate the payoff of any proposed strategy. Can they write down an algorithm that will quickly locate the best set of choices? It turns out that the answer hinges on K . As the degree of interaction among a ﬁrm’s decisions rises, the NK problem goes from being a member of the P class of problems to being NP -complete. The time required for any algorithm to ﬁnd the best strategy switches from being a polynomial function of N to being an exponential function of N (under the standard assumption that P \u0005 NP ). To see this, ﬁrst consider the NK model with no interactions, K \u0001 0. Trivially, this can be solved in polynomial time by an algorithm that optimizes each of the N decisions one-by-one, by choosing the better of the two alternatives. The time complexity function associated with this problem is simply a linear func- tion of N . An appendix available from the author proves, however, that the NK model with K \u0006 2 produces an NP -complete problem. The proof proceeds roughly as follows: The NK problem with K \u0006 2 is ﬁrst shown to belong to the NP class. A particular problem that is widely known to be NP -complete, the so-called “ K - satisﬁability problem,” is then chosen. Since the K -satisﬁability problem is NP -complete, it is as hard as any in the NP class. It is next shown that any K -satisﬁability problem can be transformed in polyno- mial time into an NK model with K \u0006 2. Such an NK problem is therefore at least as hard as the K -satisﬁ- ability problem; if the NK problem could be solved in polynomial time, then one could also solve the K - satisﬁability problem in polynomial time by trans- forming it into an NK problem and solving the trans- formed problem. In sum, the NK problem with K \u0006 2 is in the NP class and is at least as hard as the K -satisﬁability problem, which itself is at least as hard as any problem in NP . One concludes that the NK",

In the low- K cate- gory, decision problems are easy, and great strategies are quickly deciphered and matched. When K is high, problems are complex, and a successful resolution of a decision problem may defy discovery for an exponen- tially long period. The generality of this result is worth emphasizing. It applies to any step-by-step search procedure that one could write down. It encompasses procedures ranging from simple exhaustive search to sophisticated approaches that send “probes” into the landscape and react to the results. For K \u0006 2, the strategy decision problem is intrac- table in the technical sense of the word. The problem becomes intractable in the vernacular sense, however, only when two further conditions hold: the number of decisions N is substantial, and the time involved in each algorithmic step is not trivial. Some examples make this clear. When N \u0001 5 and a proposed strategy can be evaluated in an hour, for example, a very simple algorithm—exhaustive search—will pinpoint the global optimum in a mere 2 5 \u0001 32 hours. When N grows to 20, however, the solution time associated with exhaustive search rises to 120 years.

(Evalua- tion time reﬂects either the time required to conduct a study of an alternative strategy or the time necessary to implement a test and receive feedback.) Only when N is very low and the evaluation time very brief does exhaustive search appear practical. The NP -completeness result alone does not imply that complexity deters imitation. The result ensures only that complexity undermines global optimization . When facing a complex decision problem, thoughtful managers presumably understand the futility of try- ing to “solve” the problem and match the performance of a benchmark ﬁrm by any algorithmic means. Rather, they likely use simple heuristics and attempt to learn directly from the successful ﬁrm. The remain- ing challenge, then, is to show that complexity also undermines the heuristics and attempts at learning. Sections 4 and 5 tackle this challenge. The NP -completeness result suggests interpreta- tions for two phenomena that are unrelated to imita- tion. First, it is commonly posited that managers satisﬁce rather than optimize (e.g., March and Simon 1958, Nelson and Winter 1982). Satisﬁcing seems a sensible course of action if the strategy formulation problem is NP -complete; managers have little choice but to use heuristics and judgment to seek good, albeit not necessarily optimal, conﬁgurations of decisions. Second, the NP -completeness ﬁnding suggests that in complex settings, some very good strategies may go undiscovered for long periods. Thus a successful new way of doing business may emerge “out of the blue”",

Finally, the NP -completeness of the strategy formu- lation problem poses a question for the recent, impor- tant stream of research on complementarities (e.g., Milgrom and Roberts 1990, 1995; Topkis 1998 and references therein). Like this paper, the complementa- rity research drops the assumption, often made by economists, that managers must make only a handful of decisions. It also emphasizes the role played by interactions among choice variables. In contrast to this paper, however, the complementarities research is interested primarily in comparative statics: how do optimal sets of decisions concerning complementary variables shift as underlying parameters change? Con- sider, for instance, the array of decisions which an auto manufacturer must make concerning price, ma- chine ﬂexibility, product variety, the length of produc- tion runs, inventory, vertical integration, and human resource practices. How does the best set of decisions shift as exogenous factors change—say, as the costs of data communication, computation, and ﬂexible ma- chines fall? The power of the complementarity approach is that it identiﬁes the weakest conditions under which one can say anything about such questions. Roughly, Topkis, Milgrom and Roberts, and others show that one can make clean comparative static predictions if and only if the auto maker’s proﬁt \u0004 ( x , p ) is super- modular in decision variables x and outside parame- ters p . That is, the marginal return to increasing any variable must increase with any other variable, for all values of all other variables. Under those conditions, the optimal choice x \u0001 ( p ) is monotone nondecreasing in p . Milgrom and Roberts (1990) use these results to show how declining costs of communication, comput- ers, and ﬂexible machines could prompt an optimizing ﬁrm to lower prices, invest in ﬂexible production, broaden product lines, shorten production runs, re- duce inventory, buy inputs rather than make them, and adopt team-based human resource practices. The NP -completeness result, however, illustrates a situation in which interactions among numerous de- cisions make the global optimum difﬁcult to ﬁnd. This",

How relevant are comparative statics when optimiza- tion might be a poor model of behavior? The dilemma is eased, to a certain extent, by the fact that Milgrom and Roberts et al. examine comparative statics only for supermodular functions, in which an increase in each decision variable always raises the incremental returns to all others. ( NK landscapes are much more general. With a payoff function generated by the NK model, altering a decision may increase or decrease the incremental returns to another decision, and the sign of the effect may depend on the choices made concerning other decisions.) Finding a good set of decisions on a supermodular landscape is, in certain senses, easier than ﬁnding one on a general NK landscape. On a supermodular landscape, for in- stance, one can test whether a candidate point is a global optimum by surveying just the two orthants above and below the candidate (Milgrom and Roberts 1995, p. 185); on a general landscape, one would have to consider all 2 N orthants. Starting at any point on a supermodular landscape, a ﬁrm that scours only those two orthants is sure to get at least half of the gains that an exhaustive search would yield (Milgrom and Rob- erts 1995, p. 185); on a general landscape, such a limited search might produce none of the gains. For particular restricted classes of problems with super- modular payoff functions, polynomial-time algo- rithms are known to exist. (Speciﬁcally, the ellipsoid method can solve problems involving supermodular set functions in polynomial time (Gro¨tschel et al. 1988, Chapter 10).) Although the structure imposed by supermodularity makes global optimization easier, it by no means makes it easy. The time required to survey two orthants may easily rise exponentially with the size of a problem. Polynomial-time algorithms are not known to exist for most types of problems with supermodular payoff func- tions. Even when they do exist, they can be very time- consuming: “theoretically efﬁcient” but not “practically efﬁcient” (Gro¨tschel et al. 1988, Chapter 3).

For the extreme cases of K \u0001 0 and K \u0001 N \u0002 1, average peak height is easily calculated using order statistics and the Central Limit Theorem. As shown in Table 3, N has no effect on peak elevation when decisions are independent of one another ( K \u0001 0). In contrast, when interactions are pervasive ( K \u0001 N \u0002 1), increasing N causes the expected peak height to fall. In the large- N limit, ﬁrm value on a local peak declines to 0.5, which is no better than the value expected from a randomly selected set of choices. Calculating the heights of local optima is",

By the N \u0001 24, K \u0001 11 case, only 37 of the 5,000 imitators match the bench- mark. Local peaks become numerous and the typical imitator gets stranded well below and far away from the best strategy. Panel B highlights the crucial role played by K , relative to N . It is the interaction among numerous decisions, not the mere proliferation of decisions, that harms the incremental improver. Table 5 examines the evolution of the benchmark under the incremental improvement heuristic. For each level of N and K , one thousand ﬁrms are released sequentially on each of 20 landscapes, and each ﬁrm exhausts its opportunities for local improvement. Panel A records the number of times that a new ﬁrm establishes a new, higher standard for performance. Panel B reports the number of times that a new ﬁrm matches (but does not exceed) the existing benchmark. Panel C analyzes the number of ﬁrms released before each new benchmark is matched or exceeded; i.e., it measures how long each new benchmark remains unbeaten. New, superior strategies are discovered more frequently on complex landscapes (panel A), and such strategies are far more rarely matched in complex settings (panel B). Consequently, benchmark ﬁrms have much longer runs of success when deci- sions are numerous and intertwined (panel C).",

An imitator does not try to match a successful rival solely by making uninformed, local “tweaks” to its own choices. Rather, it observes the high performer closely: reverse- engineers its products, interviews its customers and former employees, speaks with its suppliers, dissects its public literature, benchmarks its every activity, and so forth. Once well informed, the imitator changes a large number of its choices—leaps in decision space toward the conﬁguration of the successful ﬁrm—in hope of landing somewhere near the proﬁtable strat- egy. From there, it edges uphill. Complexity makes this style of imitation less effec-",

Nonetheless, the would-be imitator hopes that it will come close enough to the successful set of deci- sions that subsequent “tweaks” will take it to the peak. Such a wholesale reconﬁguration is successful only if the imitator’s leap lands in the basin of attraction below the high performer’s peak. Unfortunately for the imitator, complexity under- mines its leap. When decisions are numerous and richly cross-coupled, the attraction basins of high peaks become small, and the odds of jumping into them grow correspondingly poor. To see this, consider the extreme cases of K \u0001 0 and K \u0001 N \u0002 1, with M \u0001 1. For K \u0001 0, of course, the basin of attraction of the global peak is the entire landscape regardless of N , and incremental improvements will take a ﬁrm from any set of choices to the best conﬁguration. The accuracy of a long jump is irrelevant. For K \u0001 N \u0002 1, however, the situation is very different. Consider the global peak, which typically has among the broadest basins of attraction. The portion of points from which a ﬁrm can tweak its way to the global peak dwindles rapidly with N . The basin of the global peak covers only 7% of the landscape when N \u0001 8, K \u0001 7, and less than 0.5% when N \u0001 16, K \u0001 15.",

The higher peaks tend to be near “Everest” and the lower peaks far away. As K rises, the correlation fades and high peaks spread apart. The location of a high peak carries less and less information about where other high summits can be found. The intuition behind this is straightforward. When choices are loosely connected, the strategy of a suc- cessful ﬁrm can typically be decomposed into separa- ble subsystems of well-made choices (Simon 1962). Reconﬁguring one of the subsystems has limited effect on the others and generates a new local peak that is quite close in decision space to the original one. The mountain range around Everest consists of Everest- like decision conﬁgurations with individual sub- systems modiﬁed. In contrast, when choices are tightly interlocked, the strategy of a successful ﬁrm cannot be broken into subsystems. High peaks are then likely to be altogether different ways of doing business rather than slight variations on a theme. When interactivity is strong, slight variations destroy the theme. Note the special role played by K in determining these structural features. Never does an increase in N alone, the mere number of decisions a ﬁrm faces, impede imitators. Both structural obstacles discussed here (as well as the two considered in §4.1) hinge crucially on K . Interactions, then, are at the core of the imitation barrier proposed in this paper. High values of N are important in deterring imitation largely because they create rich opportunities for interactions.",

This is true because the space of possible model speciﬁcations and parameter values is vast, far too large to explore by exhaustive search. Nonetheless, several features of §§3–5 should reassure the reader that the main result, that complexity deters imitation, is robust. First, the analytical techniques employed from algorithm the- ory do not rely on simulation. Second, the reported results are averages over large numbers of simulation trials. Third, the simulations span the full range of parameter values permitted by a state-of-the-art per- sonal computer. Fourth, the simulations explore a variety of search heuristics. Fifth and ﬁnally, the discussion tries to elucidate the structural features that give rise to the simulation results, and the intuition behind those features, before it turns to simulation. An appendix available on request subjects the model to a further battery of robustness tests. The results are not sensitive to the arbitrary assumption that contributions C i are drawn from a U [0, 1] distri- bution. Nor are they sensitive to the assumptions that the K decisions affecting each C i are assigned at random and that all decisions are equally inﬂuential ex ante. I also consider three alternative ways to identify the benchmark strategy: as the globally opti- mal strategy; as the highest point discovered in an exhaustive search over a ﬁxed fraction of the land- scape; and as the highest point discovered in an exhaustive search over a ﬁxed number of strategies. In all cases, complexity makes imitators worse off, and results are largely comparable to those reported here. The result of virtually any model can be shaken, however, if one alters the model dramatically enough. An important question is, what are the least extreme modiﬁcations that undo the main result? In exploring the model under a wide range of conditions, I noted three modiﬁcations that neutralize complexity as an obstacle to imitation. First, the barrier to follow-the- leader imitation disappears if imitators understand the high performer’s strategy thoroughly and can",

Similarly, and as noted in §3.3, the NP -completeness result loses its force if imitators can evaluate alternative strategies very rapidly and N is modest. Exhaustive search then becomes practical. Of these three conditions, the one that seems most likely to arise in reality is that N , the number of decisions over which managers have true latitude, is limited.

When the decisions that embody a strategy are numerous and tightly linked to one another, a ﬁrm that discovers an effective combi- nation of choices is protected against imitation in three ways. First, interactions among the decisions make the strategy formulation problem intractable. When the number of decisions is large and strategy evaluation is time consuming, this undermines any logical, algo- rithmic attempt to rediscover the high performer’s strategy. Second, a would-be imitator that tries to match the successful strategy by incremental improve- ment will soon ﬁnd itself snared in a web of conﬂicting constraints. Finally, a would-be imitator that attempts to match the high performer’s entire system, via a wholesale reconﬁguration, is also likely to fail. Sup- pose it succeeds in imitating most of the high perform- er’s decisions but misses on a handful. Then because the decisions’ effects are tightly knit together, the overall imitation attempt will probably be a failure. Due to the complexity barrier to imitation, success- ful strategies may remain unmatched even though they are open to public scrutiny and even after many of their critical ingredients are adopted by competi- tors. This may help to explain the persistent superior performance of certain ﬁrms, as mentioned in §1. It may also shed light on the slow diffusion of complex",

There may be some truth in the popular business wisdom that the whole of a strategy can resist imitation more effectively than the sum of its parts. The analysis is also consistent with Sorenson’s (1997) ﬁnding that tight coupling confers a contempo- raneous advantage on computer workstation makers. Sorenson takes vertical integration as a proxy for the extent of interaction across decisions ( K ) and ﬁnds that more integrated organizations have a lower mor- tality rate at a point in time. His interpretation is that integration allows ﬁrms to realize operating efﬁcien- cies, exploit market power, tap synergies across verti- cal stages, or reduce uncertainty. It is also possible, however, that tight integration is advantageous be- cause it protects a successful workstation maker from copycats. In addition to illuminating well-established pat- terns, the analysis suggests new empirical ﬁngerprints that complexity might leave behind. Where decisions are numerous and interconnected, one expects imita- tion attempts to be less successful, and perhaps less common, than they are where strategies are relatively simple. This suggests that the distribution of ﬁrm performance will be broader and convergence to mean performance will be slower in settings with more complex strategies. Indeed, industries differ substan- tially in the range of performance levels they exhibit and in their speed of convergence (Waring 1996), and conventional industrial organization variables explain these cross-industry differences incompletely. A nat- ural hypothesis is that proxies for industry complexity would help to explain the residual differences. The impediment to imitation I propose arises purely from the character of the decision problem and the nature of search. It owes nothing to the game-theoretic considerations or resource barriers that have domi-",

In the present paper, however, it is difﬁcult to label any isolated decision as strategic. No single choice is innately sticky. What does appear strategic by traditional standards is the choice of a particular logic of conﬁguration, a local peak. The stickiness of individual choices is then endogenous; once a ﬁrm adopts a speciﬁc conﬁgura- tion or peak, changes in individual choices become costly. Likewise, the consequences of individual deci- sions become large because they undermine the effec-",

They then show how uncertainty in imitation can lead to persistent performance differences and above-normal rates of return despite free entry, proﬁt-maximizing behavior, no scale economies, and no market power. They never explain, however, the roots of causal ambiguity, nor do they specify how it deters imitation. The complex- ity explored here can certainly underlie causal ambiguity. When a winning strategy consists of numerous, interlocking decisions, it is nearly impossible to assign credit for any part of the success to any isolated choice. Success arises from the whole, not the parts, so cause and effect are blurred. On the other hand, complexity can deter imitation even when causal ambiguity is altogether absent. This arises, for instance, if the managers of the would-be imitator understand causal connections perfectly but have imperfect control over internal operations. Hence, complexity may underpin causal ambiguity, but it may also operate independently of ambiguity.",

Recent research on complemen- tary bundles of organizational practices gives at least some evidence that this occurs. The world depicted in this paper could lead one to a fatalistic view of management: seemingly minor decisions can be salient, relationships among decisions are thoroughly unknown a priori, algorithmic analysis of decision problems is doomed, and reasonable heu- ristics leave ﬁrms trapped in webs of conﬂicting constraints. What role is there, then, for management science or managerial choice in a complex world? My belief is that major roles remain. I highlight two. First, the analysis in this paper should make clear the power and importance of anticipating the relation- ships among decisions. An imitator who understands that a particular pair of choices should always be adjusted in unison effectively reduces the number of decisions and the number of interactions that she must actively consider. As the numerical results make clear, modest reductions in the dimensionality of the deci- sion problem can make imitation signiﬁcantly easier. Even an understanding that certain variables usually, though not always, move together can be powerful. This is one reason that recent work on complementa- rity and supermodularity have generated such inter- est. As discussed in §3, the structure imposed by supermodularity can greatly simplify managerial search. This also helps to explain recurring efforts to classify strategies into a manageable number of ge- neric types (e.g., Miles and Snow 1978, Porter 1980). Such taxonomies hold out the hope that only a hand- ful of coherent sets of choices exist. If true, this simpliﬁes the managerial search problem dramati- cally. Empirical support for taxonomies is mixed (e.g., Miller and Dess 1993), suggesting that they may simplify decision problems too much. An important role of management science is to isolate relationships that truly, reliably exist among decisions and thereby to simplify decision problems (without simplifying them falsely). Analyses in the paper also hint at the potency of altering the relationships among decisions. In the for- mal models described here, managers take N and K as",

Hence a successful ﬁrm might build new and elaborate connec- tions between, say, its production and marketing operations in order to fend off imitators. Alternatively, an imitator may try to break a successful strategy into discrete pieces and attack each piece in turn. A ﬁrm might expand its scope of operations, increasing N , or focus on a portion of the total value chain, reducing N . In altering the complexity of its strategy, a ﬁrm will face the tension identiﬁed in §1: a more modular, less coupled system adjusts more readily to environmental change and is less subject to inertia (Levinthal 1997, Sorenson 1997), but it is more easily attacked by imitators. Baldwin and Clark (2000) observe precisely this tension in the evolution of the computer industry. By adopting modular architectures in the mainframe industry and later in the personal computer market, IBM made itself and its products far more responsive to market needs. This approach, however, allowed widespread entry by imitators. Loosely coupled orga- nizations, it appears, are responsive to change, but vulnerable to imitation. A natural implication, worthy of further research, is that designers of organizations must decide which they fear more: inertia or imita- tion. 6",
