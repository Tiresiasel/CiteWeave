    description: >
      A central argumentative statement that articulates the paperâ€™s key theoretical or empirical contribution. 
      Often appears in the introduction or conclusion and is typically supported by empirical or logical evidence.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "We argue that firms respond to reputation shocks by strategically adjusting price anchors."
      - "This paper shows that quality signals have heterogeneous effects across market types."

  - id: CLAIM_SUPPORTING
    label: supporting_claim
    description: >
      A statement that logically supports the main claim or extends it through sub-arguments. 
      These often appear in body sections and are built on theory, mechanisms, or preliminary findings.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "This mechanism is particularly salient when product quality is unobservable ex-ante."
      - "The reputation channel is amplified in highly regulated sectors."

  - id: EVIDENCE_EMPIRICAL
    label: empirical_evidence
    description: >
      A statement based on collected data, statistical analysis, or observed patterns.
      Typically references regression results, descriptive patterns, or quantitative metrics.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "As shown in Table 2, prices dropped by 14% following the disruption event (p < 0.01)."

  - id: EVIDENCE_THEORETICAL
    label: theoretical_evidence
    description: >
      A logic-based or model-derived statement that supports a claim using theory or deduction, 
      often without direct empirical testing.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "According to signaling theory, firms with private information use price as a credible cue."
      - "Game-theoretic reasoning suggests a separating equilibrium under uncertainty."

  - id: EVIDENCE_LITERATURE
    label: literature_evidence
    description: >
      A citation-based argument that draws support from prior published research.
      Often uses phrases like 'consistent with', 'similar to', or references specific authors.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "This aligns with findings from Zhao and Lee (2020), who showed similar pricing behavior."
      - "Comparable results were reported in studies of Airbnb hosts by Martin et al. (2019)."

  - id: COUNTERARGUMENT
    label: counterargument
    description: >
      A statement that reflects or anticipates opposing viewpoints or potential objections.
      Used to show robustness or address alternative interpretations.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "One might argue that regulatory constraints, not strategy, explain the price shift."
      - "Critics may contend that reputation effects are confounded with category norms."

  - id: REBUTTAL
    label: rebuttal
    description: >
      A direct response to a counterargument that aims to invalidate, qualify, or disprove it.
      Often includes new evidence or logical refutation.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "However, our robustness checks indicate that cost structures are unlikely drivers."
      - "Even after excluding firms in regulated sectors, the effect persists."

  - id: CONTEXT_LIMITATION
    label: context_limitation
    description: >
      A statement that clarifies the scope or applicability conditions of a claim or result.
      Typically uses constraints like time, geography, sample, or method.

    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "These results hold primarily in markets with low product differentiation."
      - "Our sample is limited to firms operating in North America between 2014 and 2022."

  - id: METHODOLOGY
    label: methodology
    description: >
      A factual description of the research design, data, model specification, or procedure.
      These are usually not argumentative but are essential for interpreting claims.

    examples:
      - "We implement a difference-in-differences approach using matched firms from adjacent states."

  - id: ASSUMPTION
    label: assumption
    description: >
      A stated or implied condition necessary for the validity of a model, inference, or theory.
      Typically untested within the study and may relate to behavior, structure, or data.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "We assume that firms observe market signals without noise."
      - "The model presumes consumers update beliefs rationally."

  - id: QUESTION_MOTIVATION
