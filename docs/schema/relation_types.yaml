  - id: CITES
    label: cites
    description: >
      A directed reference from one argument or paper to another paper or argument, indicating that the former draws upon the latter.
      Typically corresponds to formal citations, literature mentions, or embedded references.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "As discussed in Porter (1980), strategic positioning shapes industry structure."
      - "This finding is consistent with earlier results reported by Zhang et al. (2015)."

  - id: SUPPORTS
    label: supports
    description: >
      A relationship where one argument explicitly strengthens or reinforces another argument, claim, or proposition.
      Often grounded in logic, mechanism expansion, or additional validation.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "The model result further supports our claim about entry deterring behavior."
      - "This mechanism gives theoretical support to the claim about consumer uncertainty."

  - id: REFUTES
    label: refutes
    description: >
      A relation where one argument explicitly contradicts or disproves another.
      Typically involves logical disagreement, empirical rejection, or critique of assumptions.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "Contrary to prior work, our findings reject the first-mover advantage thesis."
      - "This evidence refutes the selection-based explanation proposed by Lee (2020)."

  - id: ELABORATES
    label: elaborates
    description: >
      Indicates that one argument develops, clarifies, or extends another in greater detail.
      Often used when breaking down a broad idea into subcomponents or providing deeper explanation.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "To elaborate, this pricing behavior unfolds in three stages..."
      - "We now provide a more granular account of how quality is inferred."

  - id: QUALIFIES
    label: qualifies
    description: >
      A logical softening or conditionalizing of a claim. The second argument introduces limitations, boundary conditions, or caveats to the first.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "However, this only holds when consumers face high switching costs."
      - "The effect is significant, but only among firms with low baseline ratings."

  - id: EXTENDS
    label: extends
    description: >
      An argument builds on, modifies, or generalizes a previous argument or model to a new context, dataset, or framework.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "We extend Anderson and Tushmanâ€™s model by introducing cross-platform dynamics."
      - "Our framework generalizes prior work to multi-sided markets."

  - id: CONTRASTS
    label: contrasts
    description: >
      Indicates that two arguments are presented in comparison, showing differing approaches or outcomes without necessarily refuting one another.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "Unlike the signaling-based account, this explanation rests on coordination theory."
      - "Our empirical result stands in contrast to the null findings in older settings."

  - id: REPEATS
    label: repeats
    description: >
      A restatement or reiteration of a prior claim without adding new logic or evidence. 
      May be used for emphasis or clarity but carries no independent argumentative weight.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "This confirms our earlier assertion about price rigidity."
      - "We reiterate that regulation may redirect but not suppress innovation."

  - id: INSPIRED_BY
    label: inspired_by
    description: >
      Indicates that the source argument or paper influenced the research question, framing, or theoretical approach of the target, without a direct citation.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "Our work is conceptually inspired by the dynamic capabilities perspective."
      - "Although not directly citing them, our thinking aligns with Gawer and Cusumano."

  - id: USES_METHOD_OF
    label: uses_method_of
    description: >
      The current argument or paper adopts, adapts, or relies on a methodological approach developed by the cited source.
      Emphasizes analytical lineage over theoretical continuity.
    is_default: true
    is_deprecated: false
    examples:
      - "We adopt the synthetic control method developed by Abadie et al. (2010)."
      - "Our matching procedure follows the approach used in Athey & Imbens (2017)."
