You are given a cleaned section of a research article that contains the reference list.

Your task is to extract all individual reference entries from the text. Each entry includes the authors, publication year, title, and source.

The reference entries may be broken across lines, and formatting might be inconsistent due to PDF extraction artifacts.

Please extract all **complete** references and return them as a **Python list of strings** (JSON-compatible). Each string must contain exactly one complete reference entry.

Do not include in-text citations or anything unrelated to the reference list.
