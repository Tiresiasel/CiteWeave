## Recent Development Progress


## Renewed GraphDB Structure (2025-07-21)
- **Major structural change:** The citation relationships in the graph are now strictly from Sentence→Paper and Paragraph→Paper. The previous Argument→Paper citation relationships have been removed/replaced. This ensures all citation edges are anchored at the sentence or paragraph level, making the graph structure more precise, queryable, and robust.
- Unified paper_id generation using `PaperIDGenerator` (SHA256) for all Paper nodes and embedding payloads
- GraphDB `Paragraph` node now includes `has_citations` attribute
- DocumentProcessor and GraphDB integration: Paragraph creation now sets `has_citations` based on `citation_count`
- Updated `docs/data_structures/README.md` to reflect current graph and embedding database structure
- Confirmed that all graph operations (`MERGE`) are idempotent (no duplicate nodes/edges)
- Added/updated test scripts for graph structure and citation relationships 

### CitationParser Module - COMPLETED ✅ (2025-07-14)

**Status**: Fully implemented and tested with comprehensive coverage

**Key Features Implemented**:
- ✅ **Narrative Citation Detection**: Supports "Smith (2020)" format with various prefixes
- ✅ **Parenthetical Citation Detection**: Handles "(Smith, 2020; Jones, 2019)" format  
- ✅ **Multi-word Author Names**: Correctly processes "Van Der Berg (2020)", "World Health Organization (2021)"
- ✅ **Unicode Character Support**: Full support for international names (Turkish, German, French, Spanish, Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Nordic characters)
- ✅ **Complex Multi-author Citations**: Handles "Smith, Jones, and Brown (2020)" and "et al." formats
- ✅ **Prefix Processing**: Intelligently handles academic prefixes like "According to", "Research by", "As noted by", etc.
- ✅ **False Positive Filtering**: Advanced validation to prevent incorrect matches
- ✅ **Multiple Citations per Sentence**: Detects multiple narrative citations in the same sentence

**Test Results**:
- Standard Citation Tests: **29/29 PASSED** (100%)
- Unicode Character Tests: **24/24 PASSED** (100%)
- Total Test Coverage: **53/53 PASSED** (100%)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Multi-layered regex pattern matching for different citation types
- Unicode-aware character pattern generation
- Smart overlap detection for multiple citations
- Comprehensive prefix handling for academic writing styles
- Integration with GROBID for reference extraction and matching

**Files Modified**:
- `src/citation_parser.py` - Core implementation
- `tests/test_intext_citation_extraction.py` - Comprehensive test suite
