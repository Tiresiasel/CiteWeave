## Recent Development Progress

### CitationParser Module - COMPLETED ✅ (2024-12)

**Status**: Fully implemented and tested with comprehensive coverage

**Key Features Implemented**:
- ✅ **Narrative Citation Detection**: Supports "Smith (2020)" format with various prefixes
- ✅ **Parenthetical Citation Detection**: Handles "(Smith, 2020; Jones, 2019)" format
